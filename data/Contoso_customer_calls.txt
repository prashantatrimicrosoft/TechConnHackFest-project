CALL #001 - Apex Solutions (Healthcare)
Date: 2026-02-11
Participants: 5
================================================================================

[00:00] Matthew Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Matthew Martinez and I'll be walking you through Foundry IQ implementation for Apex Solutions.

[00:08] Matthew Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Let me quickly introduce everyone on the call.

[00:12] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
Hi everyone, I'm Michelle Lee, Solution Engineer on the project.

[00:17] Emily Thompson (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, I'm Emily Thompson, Data Engineer on the project.

[00:22] Lisa Jackson (Technical Lead):
Hi everyone, I'm Lisa Jackson, Technical Lead on the project.

[00:27] Daniel Jones (Solution Architect):
Hi everyone, I'm Daniel Jones, Solution Architect on the project.

[00:37] Matthew Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
What about data privacy? That's critical for our implementation.

[00:48] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
Right, and we can use Quiver for the complex analytical queries. The query optimization in Foundry IQ is pretty impressive.

[01:03] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
We should also plan for the ETL jobs. I'm thinking we use the Code Repositories feature to version control our transformations.

[01:14] Lisa Jackson (Technical Lead):
I think we can have the basic ontology and core pipelines ready in about 6 weeks, then iterate from there.

[01:24] Matthew Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Yes, I've created a draft ontology with about 15 object types. The main challenge is the data sync frequency - we need near real-time for some datasets.

[01:38] Daniel Jones (Solution Architect):
From a data privacy perspective, we need to ensure the integration follows best practices. I've been reviewing the API documentation.

[01:47] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
Sounds good. Thanks everyone for the productive discussion.

[02:02] Emily Thompson (Data Engineer):
Foundry IQ supports streaming ingestion through the event-based pipelines. We could leverage that for time-sensitive data.

[02:17] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
So let's dive into the architecture. We're looking at implementing Foundry IQ primarily for patient analytics. What are your thoughts on the data pipeline design?

[02:28] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
Agreed. Are there any blockers we need to address before we proceed?

[02:42] Matthew Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
I've worked with the Workshop module before - it's quite powerful for building custom applications on top of the ontology.

[02:57] Daniel Jones (Solution Architect):
Have we discussed the deployment model? Are we going cloud-native or hybrid?

[03:11] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
Yes, Foundry IQ supports data quality checks at multiple stages. We can add assertions and schema validations.

[03:24] Matthew Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
I'm concerned about data quality. Can we implement validation checks in the pipeline?

[03:37] Emily Thompson (Data Engineer):
Definitely. And we can set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of those transformations.

[03:45] Lisa Jackson (Technical Lead):
What's the timeline looking like for the initial MVP?

[03:55] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
For the patient analytics use case, we'll need to create several derived datasets. The build scheduler will be important there.

[04:03] Matthew Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
We're planning for a cloud deployment on AWS. Foundry IQ integrates well with existing cloud infrastructure.

[04:13] Lisa Jackson (Technical Lead):
Good point. Foundry IQ has built-in governance features. We can configure data lineage tracking and implement role-based access controls at the ontology level.

[04:24] Emily Thompson (Data Engineer):
Perfect. Let's set up a follow-up call for next week to review the initial setup.

[04:34] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
I think we should consider a multi-layered approach. We can use Foundry IQ's data transformation capabilities to build our intermediate layer.

[04:42] Emily Thompson (Data Engineer):
Agreed. We'll need to set up the ontology properly. Have we mapped out all the object types we need to ingest?

[04:55] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
That works. Let's make sure we document everything properly in the Foundry IQ metadata.

[05:09] Michelle Lee (Solution Engineer):
Just need final approval on the data security protocols. Should have that by end of week.

Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Michael Martinez and I'll be walking you through Foundry IQ implementation for Vertex Group.

[00:08] Michael Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Let me quickly introduce everyone on the call.

[00:12] Robert Garcia (Product Manager):
Hi everyone, I'm Robert Garcia, Product Manager on the project.

[00:17] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
Hi everyone, I'm Jessica Anderson, Customer Success Manager on the project.

[00:22] Ashley Martinez (Technical Lead):
Hi everyone, I'm Ashley Martinez, Technical Lead on the project.

[00:32] Ashley Martinez (Technical Lead):
Right, and we can use Quiver for the complex analytical queries. The query optimization in Foundry IQ is pretty impressive.

[00:40] Ashley Martinez (Technical Lead):
Have we discussed the deployment model? Are we going cloud-native or hybrid?

[00:54] Robert Garcia (Product Manager):
From a inventory optimization perspective, we need to ensure the integration follows best practices. I've been reviewing the API documentation.

[01:07] Robert Garcia (Product Manager):
So let's dive into the architecture. We're looking at implementing Foundry IQ primarily for pricing optimization. What are your thoughts on the data pipeline design?

[01:19] Ashley Martinez (Technical Lead):
We're planning for a cloud deployment on AWS. Foundry IQ integrates well with existing cloud infrastructure.

[01:29] Michael Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Just need final approval on the data security protocols. Should have that by end of week.

[01:44] Robert Garcia (Product Manager):
I've worked with the Workshop module before - it's quite powerful for building custom applications on top of the ontology.

[01:54] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
Good point. Foundry IQ has built-in governance features. We can configure data lineage tracking and implement role-based access controls at the ontology level.

[02:04] Robert Garcia (Product Manager):
I'm concerned about data quality. Can we implement validation checks in the pipeline?

[02:14] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
Foundry IQ supports streaming ingestion through the event-based pipelines. We could leverage that for time-sensitive data.

[02:23] Ashley Martinez (Technical Lead):
Yes, Foundry IQ supports data quality checks at multiple stages. We can add assertions and schema validations.

[02:34] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
I think we should consider a multi-layered approach. We can use Foundry IQ's data transformation capabilities to build our intermediate layer.

[02:44] Ashley Martinez (Technical Lead):
For the pricing optimization use case, we'll need to create several derived datasets. The build scheduler will be important there.

[02:56] Michael Martinez (Solution Engineer):
That works. Let's make sure we document everything properly in the Foundry IQ metadata.

[03:05] Ashley Martinez (Technical Lead):
Definitely. And we can set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of those transformations.

[03:17] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
I think we can have the basic ontology and core pipelines ready in about 6 weeks, then iterate from there.

[03:25] Michael Martinez (Solution Engineer):
What's the timeline looking like for the initial MVP?

[03:35] Michael Martinez (Solution Engineer):
We should also plan for the ETL jobs. I'm thinking we use the Code Repositories feature to version control our transformations.

[03:50] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. Thanks everyone for the productive discussion.

[04:00] Robert Garcia (Product Manager):
Yes, I've created a draft ontology with about 15 object types. The main challenge is the data sync frequency - we need near real-time for some datasets.

[04:10] Robert Garcia (Product Manager):
Perfect. Let's set up a follow-up call for next week to review the initial setup.

[04:23] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
What about inventory optimization? That's critical for our implementation.

[04:35] Michael Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Agreed. Are there any blockers we need to address before we proceed?

[04:43] Jessica Anderson (Customer Success Manager):
Agreed. We'll need to set up the ontology properly. Have we mapped out all the object types we need to ingest?

Hi everyone, I'm Jennifer Johnson, Solution Engineer on the project.

[00:22] Sarah Thomas (Customer Success Manager):
Hi everyone, I'm Sarah Thomas, Customer Success Manager on the project.

[00:32] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
Yes, Foundry IQ supports data quality checks at multiple stages. We can add assertions and schema validations.

[00:45] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
Perfect. Let's set up a follow-up call for next week to review the initial setup.

[00:58] Jennifer Johnson (Solution Engineer):
What about cloud architecture? That's critical for our implementation.

[01:12] Sarah Thomas (Customer Success Manager):
That works. Let's make sure we document everything properly in the Foundry IQ metadata.

[01:20] Sarah Thomas (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. Thanks everyone for the productive discussion.

[01:28] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
We're planning for a cloud deployment on AWS. Foundry IQ integrates well with existing cloud infrastructure.

[01:40] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
So let's dive into the architecture. We're looking at implementing Foundry IQ primarily for system monitoring. What are your thoughts on the data pipeline design?

[01:53] Sarah Thomas (Customer Success Manager):
What's the timeline looking like for the initial MVP?

[02:06] Jennifer Johnson (Solution Engineer):
I think we can have the basic ontology and core pipelines ready in about 6 weeks, then iterate from there.

[02:16] Emily Williams (Product Manager):
Agreed. Are there any blockers we need to address before we proceed?

[02:27] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
Definitely. And we can set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of those transformations.

[02:38] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
Have we discussed the deployment model? Are we going cloud-native or hybrid?

[02:51] Sarah Thomas (Customer Success Manager):
Foundry IQ supports streaming ingestion through the event-based pipelines. We could leverage that for time-sensitive data.

[03:04] Emily Williams (Product Manager):
For the system monitoring use case, we'll need to create several derived datasets. The build scheduler will be important there.

[03:15] Jennifer Johnson (Solution Engineer):
From a cloud architecture perspective, we need to ensure the integration follows best practices. I've been reviewing the API documentation.

[03:26] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
Agreed. We'll need to set up the ontology properly. Have we mapped out all the object types we need to ingest?

[03:38] Sarah Thomas (Customer Success Manager):
I've worked with the Workshop module before - it's quite powerful for building custom applications on top of the ontology.

[03:48] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
Just need final approval on the data security protocols. Should have that by end of week.

[03:57] Emily Williams (Product Manager):
I'm concerned about data quality. Can we implement validation checks in the pipeline?

[04:10] Emily Williams (Product Manager):
I think we should consider a multi-layered approach. We can use Foundry IQ's data transformation capabilities to build our intermediate layer.

[04:20] Jennifer Johnson (Solution Engineer):
Right, and we can use Quiver for the complex analytical queries. The query optimization in Foundry IQ is pretty impressive.

[04:31] Emily Brown (Solution Architect):
Yes, I've created a draft ontology with about 15 object types. The main challenge is the data sync frequency - we need near real-time for some datasets.
