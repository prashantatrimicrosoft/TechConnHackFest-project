Duration: ~9 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Amanda Rodriguez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Quantum Systems.

[00:12] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:20] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Jennifer Chen, serving as Solution Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:26] Kevin Nakamura (Technical Lead):
Hi everyone, Kevin Nakamura here. I'm the Technical Lead on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:34] James White (Customer Success Manager):
Hey team, I'm James White, serving as Customer Success Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:39] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:50] James White (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:56] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:02] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:17] Kevin Nakamura (Technical Lead):
We have data siloed across five different EHR systems and there's no unified view of patient journeys. Clinicians are making decisions with incomplete information.

[01:39] James White (Customer Success Manager):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:53] Kevin Nakamura (Technical Lead):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[02:08] James White (Customer Success Manager):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:20] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:31] James White (Customer Success Manager):
We failed our last HIPAA audit because we couldn't demonstrate proper data lineage. We need to know exactly where patient data flows and who accessed it.

[02:51] Kevin Nakamura (Technical Lead):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[03:08] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[03:26] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:40] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[04:01] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[04:15] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[04:35] James White (Customer Success Manager):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[04:55] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[05:11] Kevin Nakamura (Technical Lead):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[05:27] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[05:43] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[06:02] Kevin Nakamura (Technical Lead):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[06:18] James White (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[06:31] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[06:51] James White (Customer Success Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[07:03] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[07:20] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[07:39] Kevin Nakamura (Technical Lead):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[07:53] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[08:09] James White (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for clinical decision support. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[08:27] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:37] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[08:48] Jennifer Chen (Solution Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:02] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:13] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:25] James White (Customer Success Manager):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[09:33] Amanda Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #002 - Horizon Enterprises (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Tom Harris and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Horizon Enterprises.

[00:11] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:17] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
Hey team, I'm Chris Martinez, serving as Technical Lead. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:23] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
Hi everyone, Robert Garcia here. I'm the Solution Architect on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:28] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:39] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:47] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:54] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:05] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
Regulators are requiring us to demonstrate model explainability for all credit scoring decisions. Our current ML pipeline is essentially a black box.

[01:22] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:34] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[01:50] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:08] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:20] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
We're processing trades across 12 different asset classes and the reconciliation process takes 6 hours. By the time discrepancies are found, settlement windows have closed.

[02:41] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[02:59] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[03:17] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:31] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:46] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:55] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
All ML model outputs must include feature importance scores and decision explanations in human-readable format for regulatory review.

[04:16] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[04:32] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
The platform must support multi-entity resolution across accounts, customers, and counterparties with configurable matching rules.

[04:48] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[05:03] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
Users must be able to define custom risk scenarios and run Monte Carlo simulations on demand.

[05:24] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:41] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
The system must generate regulatory reports in formats compliant with Basel III, MiFID II, and Dodd-Frank requirements.

[06:02] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[06:20] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:30] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
The platform must support data residency requirements across multiple jurisdictions including EU, US, and APAC.

[06:49] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:01] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
System failover must complete within 30 seconds with zero data loss for in-flight transactions.

[07:18] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[07:36] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
Transaction scoring must complete within 50 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.

[07:58] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:10] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
The platform must achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance within 6 months of deployment.

[08:32] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[08:50] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[09:01] Chris Martinez (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:15] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:29] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:42] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:54] Robert Garcia (Solution Architect):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[10:02] Tom Harris (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[02:06] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
On the inventory optimization front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[02:20] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[02:34] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):

[03:48] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[04:02] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for supply chain analytics. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[04:24] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[04:42] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[04:59] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[05:16] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[05:34] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[05:50] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):

[06:08] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[06:22] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[06:33] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
Users must be able to create and test pricing rules with A/B testing capabilities including geographic and demographic segmentation.

[06:52] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[07:06] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
The system must ingest point-of-sale data from 2,500 stores within 5 minutes of each transaction.

[07:21] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[07:36] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
The platform must support customer identity resolution across online, mobile app, in-store, and loyalty program touchpoints.

[07:57] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[08:09] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The system must generate automated replenishment recommendations based on real-time inventory levels, lead times, and forecasted demand.

[08:30] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[08:42] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[08:53] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The customer data platform must handle 50 million unique customer profiles with sub-second lookup times.

[09:14] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[09:27] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
All PII must be handled in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and applicable regional privacy regulations.

[09:46] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[10:01] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
The system must maintain data freshness of 15 minutes or less for inventory positions across all stores.

[10:18] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[10:31] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Platform must support a Black Friday traffic spike of 20x normal volume without service degradation.

[10:47] James Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[11:00] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[11:12] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[11:24] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[11:35] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[11:50] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[12:05] Wei Thompson (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[12:16] Matthew Anderson (Technical Lead):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

CALL #004 - Fusion Analytics (Manufacturing)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~16 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Brian Martinez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Fusion Analytics.

[00:10] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:19] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Hi everyone, Daniel Garcia here. I'm the Customer Success Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:24] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
Hi everyone, Lisa Jones here. I'm the Solution Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:32] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:43] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:50] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:55] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:10] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Our quality defect rate has climbed to 3.2% and we can't trace root causes because production data and quality data live in completely separate systems.

[01:30] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:46] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[02:07] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:21] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:32] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
Unplanned equipment downtime is costing us $500K per incident. We have sensors on everything but no way to correlate the data into predictive insights.

[02:49] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[03:07] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:25] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:43] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:55] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:06] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must support integration with MES, ERP, and SCADA systems through configurable connectors.

[04:27] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[04:43] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
The system must provide automated root cause analysis that correlates quality defects with upstream process parameters within 30 seconds.

[05:02] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[05:15] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
The system must ingest and process streaming data from 50,000 IoT sensors with support for OPC UA, MQTT, and Modbus protocols.

[05:34] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[05:51] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
The platform must support digital twin modeling for at least 200 pieces of critical equipment with real-time state synchronization.

[06:10] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:22] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:36] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
IoT data ingestion must support sustained throughput of 1 million events per second with at-most-once delivery guarantees.

[06:57] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[07:15] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
The platform must achieve 99.99% uptime for the real-time monitoring subsystem.

[07:37] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[07:51] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Anomaly detection alerts must fire within 5 seconds of the triggering sensor reading.

[08:12] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:25] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
System must support edge computing deployment for latency-sensitive use cases with eventual consistency to the central platform.

[08:47] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[09:03] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[09:25] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[09:47] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[10:05] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[10:27] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[10:41] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[11:00] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[11:19] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[11:34] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
On the quality control front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[11:48] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[12:06] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about the architecture for equipment monitoring. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[12:21] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
For the equipment monitoring workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[12:41] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[13:00] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[13:22] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[13:39] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[13:55] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[14:12] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[14:31] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[14:46] Lisa Jones (Solution Engineer):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[15:08] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[15:20] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[15:41] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[15:51] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[16:06] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[16:18] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[16:32] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[16:40] Daniel Garcia (Customer Success Manager):
Nothing from my side. Appreciate everyone's time. Looking forward to the next steps.

[16:46] Brian Martinez (Technical Lead):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

================================================================================

[00:00] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Michelle Moore and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for CloudScale.

[00:09] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:19] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
Hi, Matthew Thompson here, Solution Architect. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:26] Nicole Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Hi, Nicole Taylor here, Customer Success Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:32] Nicole Martin (Data Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Nicole Martin, serving as Data Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:38] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
Hi everyone, James Lee here. I'm the Solution Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:44] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:56] Nicole Martin (Data Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:06] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:11] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:23] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
Our product analytics pipeline has a 4-hour lag. Product managers are making feature decisions based on yesterday's data while A/B tests are running in real time.

[01:42] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:54] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[02:12] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:24] Nicole Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:34] Nicole Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
We've got 15 different microservices each with their own data store and there's no way to answer cross-service business questions without a week-long data engineering project.

[02:56] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[03:12] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:33] Nicole Martin (Data Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[03:49] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[04:04] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[04:20] Nicole Martin (Data Engineer):
On the API performance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[04:38] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[04:53] Nicole Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[05:07] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):

[06:03] Nicole Martin (Data Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[06:15] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about the architecture for user behavior tracking. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[06:37] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[06:51] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[07:09] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[07:23] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[07:39] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[07:55] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[08:09] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:20] James Lee (Solution Engineer):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[08:35] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[08:47] Nicole Martin (Data Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:01] Nicole Martin (Data Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:11] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:21] Matthew Thompson (Solution Architect):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[09:29] Michelle Moore (Product Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Duration: ~9 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Chris Martinez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Summit Technologies.

[00:12] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:20] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
Good morning. Michelle Brown, Product Manager. I've been working closely with the Summit Technologies team on the pre-work for this.

[00:25] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
Hi, Tom Anderson here, Solution Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:33] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, Rachel Taylor here. I'm the Data Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:39] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:51] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:01] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:09] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:21] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
We failed our last HIPAA audit because we couldn't demonstrate proper data lineage. We need to know exactly where patient data flows and who accessed it.

[01:43] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:58] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[02:14] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:30] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:39] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
We have data siloed across five different EHR systems and there's no unified view of patient journeys. Clinicians are making decisions with incomplete information.

[02:56] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[03:12] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[03:29] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[03:46] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:59] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:11] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
All data transformations must produce an auditable lineage trail showing source-to-destination data flow.

[04:33] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[04:50] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
The system must support real-time ingestion from HL7 FHIR endpoints with sub-second latency for critical patient events.

[05:05] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[05:20] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
The system must generate automated alerts when patient risk scores exceed configurable thresholds.

[05:35] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:53] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
Users must be able to build custom clinical dashboards without engineering support, using a drag-and-drop interface.

[06:08] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:20] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:30] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
The system must maintain 99.95% uptime with zero planned downtime during business hours.

[06:47] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[07:00] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
Dashboard queries must return results within 2 seconds for datasets up to 50 million records.

[07:21] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:33] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
The platform must support role-based access control with at least 15 distinct permission levels aligned to clinical roles.

[07:53] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:06] Tom Anderson (Solution Engineer):
System must be able to scale horizontally to handle a 10x increase in data volume over the next 3 years without architectural changes.

[08:24] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:38] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:48] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[08:58] Michelle Brown (Product Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:10] Rachel Taylor (Data Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:25] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:35] Chris Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

================================================================================

[00:00] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Wei Clark and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Innovate Solutions.

[00:12] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:19] Aisha Anderson (Product Manager):
Good morning. Aisha Anderson, Product Manager. I've been working closely with the Innovate Solutions team on the pre-work for this.

[00:24] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
Hey team, I'm Carlos Moore, serving as Customer Success Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:29] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
Good morning. Lisa White, Data Engineer. I've been working closely with the Innovate Solutions team on the pre-work for this.

[00:37] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[02:22] Aisha Anderson (Product Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for anti-money laundering. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[02:39] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[02:53] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
On the model risk management front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[03:12] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[03:25] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[03:43] Lisa White (Data Engineer):

[03:58] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[04:16] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[04:35] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[04:55] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[05:13] Aisha Anderson (Product Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[05:32] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[05:51] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[06:13] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[06:30] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[06:45] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[06:55] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must support multi-entity resolution across accounts, customers, and counterparties with configurable matching rules.

[07:17] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[07:30] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
The system must support real-time transaction scoring with the ability to process at least 10,000 transactions per second.

[07:50] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[08:07] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
The system must generate regulatory reports in formats compliant with Basel III, MiFID II, and Dodd-Frank requirements.

[08:22] Aisha Anderson (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[08:36] Aisha Anderson (Product Manager):
Users must be able to define custom risk scenarios and run Monte Carlo simulations on demand.

[08:56] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[09:11] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[09:23] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
System failover must complete within 30 seconds with zero data loss for in-flight transactions.

[09:39] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[09:57] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must support data residency requirements across multiple jurisdictions including EU, US, and APAC.

[10:14] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[10:26] Aisha Anderson (Product Manager):
All data must be retained for a minimum of 7 years in compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations.

[10:42] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[10:55] Lisa White (Data Engineer):
Transaction scoring must complete within 50 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.

[11:13] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[11:31] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[11:43] Carlos Moore (Customer Success Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

CALL #008 - Atlas Financial Group (Retail)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~16 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Rachel Jackson and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Atlas Financial Group.

[00:12] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:21] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Hi everyone, Priya Clark here. I'm the Customer Success Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:27] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Rachel Jones, serving as Data Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:35] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
Hi, Rachel Rodriguez here, Technical Lead. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:41] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
Good morning. David Williams, Solution Engineer. I've been working closely with the Atlas Financial Group team on the pre-work for this.

[00:46] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:55] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:02] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:10] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:24] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
We're losing $2M per quarter in markdowns because our demand forecasting is off by 20-30%. We're either overstocked or out of stock on key SKUs.

[01:44] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:59] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[02:20] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:38] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:50] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Supply chain disruptions are taking us 3-4 days to detect. By then, empty shelves have already cost us significant revenue and customer goodwill.

[03:08] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[03:23] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:45] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[04:00] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[04:12] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:22] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
The platform must support customer identity resolution across online, mobile app, in-store, and loyalty program touchpoints.

[04:44] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:01] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
The system must generate automated replenishment recommendations based on real-time inventory levels, lead times, and forecasted demand.

[05:22] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:35] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
We need a unified product catalog that reconciles SKUs across all channels with support for product hierarchy and attribute management.

[05:51] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[06:06] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The system must ingest point-of-sale data from 2,500 stores within 5 minutes of each transaction.

[06:26] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[06:39] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:53] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
The system must support 99.9% availability during store operating hours with maintenance windows limited to 2 AM - 5 AM local time.

[07:15] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:31] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The customer data platform must handle 50 million unique customer profiles with sub-second lookup times.

[07:52] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:07] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
The demand forecasting engine must process predictions for 500,000 SKUs across all locations within a 2-hour batch window.

[08:24] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:40] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
Platform must support a Black Friday traffic spike of 20x normal volume without service degradation.

[08:59] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[09:15] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[09:35] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
For the customer segmentation workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[09:50] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[10:09] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[10:27] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[10:44] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[11:00] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[11:15] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[11:36] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[11:56] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[12:10] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[12:27] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[12:49] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[13:05] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
On the real-time data front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[13:22] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[13:36] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[13:57] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[14:16] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[14:35] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[14:49] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[15:01] Rachel Jones (Data Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[15:15] Rachel Rodriguez (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[15:28] David Williams (Solution Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[15:40] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[15:51] Priya Clark (Customer Success Manager):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[15:59] Rachel Jackson (Solution Architect):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Jessica Martinez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for DataFirst.

[00:08] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:15] Tom Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Hey team, I'm Tom Martinez, serving as Customer Success Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:21] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
Hey team, I'm Michelle Johnson, serving as Product Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:27] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:39] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):

[00:45] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:51] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:05] Tom Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
Our supply chain planning still relies on spreadsheets. When a supplier misses a delivery, it takes 2 days to understand the downstream impact on production schedules.

[01:26] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[01:43] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[02:00] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:13] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:21] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
Our quality defect rate has climbed to 3.2% and we can't trace root causes because production data and quality data live in completely separate systems.

[02:36] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[02:52] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[03:11] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:24] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[03:45] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):

For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[05:24] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[05:42] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for equipment monitoring. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[05:56] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[06:12] Tom Martinez (Customer Success Manager):

[08:19] Tom Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[08:39] Jessica Martinez (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:49] Tom Martinez (Customer Success Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:04] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:17] Michelle Johnson (Product Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

================================================================================

[00:00] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Emily Miller and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Pioneer Tech.

[00:09] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:15] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
Hi, Priya Brown here, Solution Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:22] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, Jennifer Garcia here. I'm the Data Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:27] Kevin Patel (Product Manager):
Good morning. Kevin Patel, Product Manager. I've been working closely with the Pioneer Tech team on the pre-work for this.

[00:35] Daniel Martin (Solution Architect):

Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:04] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:15] Daniel Martin (Solution Architect):
Our current data platform can't handle multi-tenant isolation properly. One large customer's queries regularly slow down the entire system for everyone else.

[01:36] Kevin Patel (Product Manager):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:49] Kevin Patel (Product Manager):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[02:05] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:23] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:34] Daniel Martin (Solution Architect):
Our product analytics pipeline has a 4-hour lag. Product managers are making feature decisions based on yesterday's data while A/B tests are running in real time.

[02:51] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[03:07] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:25] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):

[03:57] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:06] Kevin Patel (Product Manager):
We need automated data pipeline monitoring with SLA tracking, freshness alerts, and dependency-aware failure notifications.

[04:25] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[04:38] Daniel Martin (Solution Architect):
The platform must provide a self-service query interface where product managers can explore data without writing SQL.

[05:00] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[05:12] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
The system must support multi-tenant data isolation with configurable compute and storage quotas per tenant.

[05:31] Daniel Martin (Solution Architect):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[05:46] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
The system must support real-time event streaming with exactly-once semantics for product analytics events.

[06:03] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:17] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:30] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
New data source onboarding must be completable by a developer in under 4 hours including schema definition and pipeline setup.

[06:49] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:04] Daniel Martin (Solution Architect):
The system must support blue-green deployments with zero-downtime upgrades.

[07:23] Kevin Patel (Product Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:38] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
Query response times for standard dashboards must be under 3 seconds for 95th percentile.

[07:54] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:12] Daniel Martin (Solution Architect):
Event ingestion must handle 500,000 events per second at peak with less than 100ms end-to-end latency.

[08:27] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[08:41] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:51] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:05] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:19] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:34] Jennifer Garcia (Data Engineer):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:44] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:53] Priya Brown (Solution Engineer):
Nothing from my side. Appreciate everyone's time. Looking forward to the next steps.

[10:00] Emily Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Let's talk about the architecture for clinical decision support. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[02:37] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[02:56] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[03:12] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
For the clinical decision support workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[03:31] Aisha Brown (Product Manager):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[03:53] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[04:14] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[04:35] Aisha Brown (Product Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[04:49] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[05:07] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[05:21] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
On the HIPAA compliance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[05:37] Aisha Brown (Product Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[05:52] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[06:14] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[06:36] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[06:52] Aisha Brown (Product Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[07:10] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[07:22] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[07:32] Aisha Brown (Product Manager):
The platform must support automated patient cohort generation based on configurable clinical criteria including ICD-10 codes, lab results, and medication history.

[07:47] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[08:02] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
All data transformations must produce an auditable lineage trail showing source-to-destination data flow.

[08:21] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[08:35] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
The system must generate automated alerts when patient risk scores exceed configurable thresholds.

[08:51] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[09:03] Aisha Brown (Product Manager):
We need the ability to run federated queries across all five EHR data sources as if they were a single dataset.

[09:22] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[09:36] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[09:48] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using AES-256 and TLS 1.3 respectively.

[10:08] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[10:25] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
System must be able to scale horizontally to handle a 10x increase in data volume over the next 3 years without architectural changes.

[10:42] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[10:56] Aisha Brown (Product Manager):
Disaster recovery must support an RPO of 1 hour and an RTO of 4 hours.

[11:12] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[11:27] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
The platform must support role-based access control with at least 15 distinct permission levels aligned to clinical roles.

[11:43] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[11:55] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[12:04] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[12:16] Chris Chen (Solution Architect):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[12:27] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[12:40] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[12:52] James Thompson (Data Engineer):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[13:02] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #012 - Fusion Analytics (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~16 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Jessica White and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Fusion Analytics.

[00:10] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
Hi, David Anderson here, Solution Architect. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:24] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, Emily Clark here. I'm the Data Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:32] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning. Chris Davis, Customer Success Manager. I've been working closely with the Fusion Analytics team on the pre-work for this.

[00:37] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Tom Chen, serving as Solution Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:45] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:57] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:03] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:11] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:25] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
Our risk models run in batch overnight but the market moves in real time. We need intraday risk recalculation to stay competitive.

[01:42] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:58] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[02:19] Jessica White (Product Manager):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:34] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:46] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Our fraud detection system has a 15% false positive rate which is costing us millions in manual review hours. We need to reduce that without increasing false negatives.

[03:02] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[03:19] Jessica White (Product Manager):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:41] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:56] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[04:10] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:18] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
The system must generate regulatory reports in formats compliant with Basel III, MiFID II, and Dodd-Frank requirements.

[04:36] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[04:49] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
The system must support real-time transaction scoring with the ability to process at least 10,000 transactions per second.

[05:07] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:21] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Users must be able to define custom risk scenarios and run Monte Carlo simulations on demand.

[05:39] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:55] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
We need full audit logging of every data access, transformation, and model execution with tamper-proof storage.

[06:15] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:32] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:43] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
All data must be retained for a minimum of 7 years in compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations.

[06:59] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:17] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
System failover must complete within 30 seconds with zero data loss for in-flight transactions.

[07:33] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:49] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Transaction scoring must complete within 50 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.

[08:10] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:22] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
The platform must achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance within 6 months of deployment.

[08:43] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[09:00] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[09:21] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[09:36] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
On the SOC 2 compliance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[09:56] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about the architecture for anti-money laundering. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[10:13] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[10:35] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):

[12:01] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[12:19] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[12:37] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[12:53] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
For the anti-money laundering workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[13:10] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[13:24] Tom Chen (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[13:43] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[13:59] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[14:15] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[14:33] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[14:49] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[15:01] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[15:16] Emily Clark (Data Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[15:30] Jessica White (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[15:42] Jessica White (Product Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[15:56] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[16:09] David Anderson (Solution Architect):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[16:19] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[16:29] Chris Davis (Customer Success Manager):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[16:36] Jessica White (Product Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

[00:00] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Carlos Clark and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for DataFirst.

[00:09] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:15] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
Hi, Wei Brown here, Product Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:21] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):
Hi, Michael Nakamura here, Technical Lead. Happy to dive into the details today.

Hi, Tom White here, Data Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:31] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:43] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):

[00:51] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:57] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:10] Tom White (Data Engineer):
Supply chain disruptions are taking us 3-4 days to detect. By then, empty shelves have already cost us significant revenue and customer goodwill.

[01:29] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[01:46] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[02:01] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:15] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:27] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):
Our pricing team is making decisions based on weekly reports. Competitors are adjusting prices hourly and we're always a step behind.

[02:44] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[02:57] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:14] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:32] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):

[04:00] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[04:15] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[04:31] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[04:50] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[05:04] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):

[06:59] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
For the demand forecasting workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[07:16] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[07:31] Michael Nakamura (Technical Lead):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[07:49] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
On the omnichannel consistency front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[08:03] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[10:32] Wei Brown (Product Manager):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[10:42] Carlos Clark (Solution Architect):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

[00:00] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Jessica Martin and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Pinnacle Retail.

[00:09] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:53] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):

[01:03] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:09] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:23] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
We're collecting 2TB of IoT data per day from the factory floor but only analyzing about 5% of it. The rest just sits in cold storage because we don't have the tools to process it.

[01:43] Carlos Jones (Solution Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:55] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[02:16] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:31] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:43] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Our quality defect rate has climbed to 3.2% and we can't trace root causes because production data and quality data live in completely separate systems.

[03:03] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[03:18] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:39] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:51] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[04:06] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:14] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Users must be able to define custom anomaly detection rules combining sensor thresholds, temporal patterns, and equipment context.

[04:30] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[04:44] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
The system must provide automated root cause analysis that correlates quality defects with upstream process parameters within 30 seconds.

[04:59] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:14] Carlos Jones (Solution Engineer):
The platform must support digital twin modeling for at least 200 pieces of critical equipment with real-time state synchronization.

[05:35] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:52] Carlos Jones (Solution Engineer):
The system must ingest and process streaming data from 50,000 IoT sensors with support for OPC UA, MQTT, and Modbus protocols.

[06:10] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:25] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:36] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
System must support edge computing deployment for latency-sensitive use cases with eventual consistency to the central platform.

[06:52] Carlos Jones (Solution Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[07:10] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
Anomaly detection alerts must fire within 5 seconds of the triggering sensor reading.

[07:27] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[07:43] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
The platform must achieve 99.99% uptime for the real-time monitoring subsystem.

[07:59] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:13] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
The platform must operate in air-gapped environments with no internet connectivity for classified production facilities.

[08:31] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[08:46] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:56] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:06] Jennifer Taylor (Solution Architect):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:16] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:28] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:36] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[09:44] Jessica Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #015 - Velocity Group (Technology)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~12 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Architecture Review
================================================================================

[00:00] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Chris Jackson and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Velocity Group.

[00:12] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:21] Carlos Davis (Product Manager):
Hi everyone, Carlos Davis here. I'm the Product Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:29] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Good morning. Wei Clark, Technical Lead. I've been working closely with the Velocity Group team on the pre-work for this.

[00:35] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
Hi, Wei Okonkwo here, Solution Architect. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:42] Priya White (Data Engineer):
Good morning. Priya White, Data Engineer. I've been working closely with the Velocity Group team on the pre-work for this.

[00:50] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[01:02] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:10] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:17] Priya White (Data Engineer):
For the user behavior tracking workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[01:34] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[01:53] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[02:05] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[02:19] Carlos Davis (Product Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[02:35] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[02:53] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[03:09] Priya White (Data Engineer):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[03:24] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[03:45] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[04:02] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[04:22] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[04:34] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[04:56] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[05:13] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about the architecture for user behavior tracking. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[05:28] Priya White (Data Engineer):
On the API performance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[05:44] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[06:02] Priya White (Data Engineer):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[06:17] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[06:31] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[06:42] Priya White (Data Engineer):
The platform must provide a unified semantic layer that abstracts across all 15 microservice data stores.

[07:02] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[07:15] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
The system must support real-time event streaming with exactly-once semantics for product analytics events.

[07:32] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[07:46] Carlos Davis (Product Manager):
We need automated feature flag integration that correlates experiment assignments with behavioral outcomes across the full conversion funnel.

[08:03] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[08:21] Priya White (Data Engineer):
We need automated data pipeline monitoring with SLA tracking, freshness alerts, and dependency-aware failure notifications.

[08:38] Carlos Davis (Product Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[08:51] Priya White (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[09:02] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
The platform must support at least 200 concurrent analytical users without query queueing.

[09:22] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[09:36] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
New data source onboarding must be completable by a developer in under 4 hours including schema definition and pipeline setup.

[09:54] Priya White (Data Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[10:06] Priya White (Data Engineer):
Data encryption must be enforced at rest and in transit with customer-managed encryption keys for enterprise tenants.

[10:22] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[10:34] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
Query response times for standard dashboards must be under 3 seconds for 95th percentile.

[10:51] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[11:09] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[11:20] Carlos Davis (Product Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[11:31] Wei Clark (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[11:44] Carlos Davis (Product Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[11:58] Carlos Davis (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[12:09] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[12:21] Wei Okonkwo (Solution Architect):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[12:29] Chris Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #016 - Acme Corp (Healthcare)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~15 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Nicole Thompson and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Acme Corp.

[00:12] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:20] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
Good morning. Lisa Davis, Solution Architect. I've been working closely with the Acme Corp team on the pre-work for this.

[00:26] Brian Garcia (Solution Engineer):
Good morning. Brian Garcia, Solution Engineer. I've been working closely with the Acme Corp team on the pre-work for this.

[00:33] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
Hi everyone, Daniel Miller here. I'm the Technical Lead on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:39] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Hey team, I'm Priya Davis, serving as Customer Success Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:47] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:55] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:01] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:06] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:16] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
Our population health models are running on stale data - sometimes 48 hours old. By the time we identify at-risk patients, interventions are already too late.

[01:36] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:53] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[02:12] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:30] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:40] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
We have data siloed across five different EHR systems and there's no unified view of patient journeys. Clinicians are making decisions with incomplete information.

[02:59] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[03:14] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:30] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:43] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:55] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:03] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
All data transformations must produce an auditable lineage trail showing source-to-destination data flow.

[04:21] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[04:36] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
The system must support real-time ingestion from HL7 FHIR endpoints with sub-second latency for critical patient events.

[04:51] Brian Garcia (Solution Engineer):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[05:08] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
The system must generate automated alerts when patient risk scores exceed configurable thresholds.

[05:29] Brian Garcia (Solution Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:46] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Users must be able to build custom clinical dashboards without engineering support, using a drag-and-drop interface.

[06:07] Brian Garcia (Solution Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:22] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:35] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using AES-256 and TLS 1.3 respectively.

[06:57] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[07:14] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
Disaster recovery must support an RPO of 1 hour and an RTO of 4 hours.

[07:34] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:51] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
The system must comply with HIPAA, HITECH, and state-level privacy regulations simultaneously.

[08:13] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:26] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Dashboard queries must return results within 2 seconds for datasets up to 50 million records.

[08:47] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[09:04] Brian Garcia (Solution Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[09:19] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[09:37] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
For the patient analytics workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[09:55] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[10:11] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[10:32] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[10:44] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[11:01] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[11:18] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[11:39] Brian Garcia (Solution Engineer):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[12:52] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[13:11] Daniel Miller (Technical Lead):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[13:27] Brian Garcia (Solution Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[13:49] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about the architecture for patient analytics. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[14:07] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):

[14:38] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[14:53] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[15:05] Lisa Davis (Solution Architect):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[15:16] Nicole Thompson (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[15:27] Priya Davis (Customer Success Manager):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

CALL #017 - Pioneer Tech (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~11 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Chris Rodriguez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Pioneer Tech.

[00:09] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
Hi, Ashley Okonkwo here, Customer Success Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:26] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
Hi, Brian Moore here, Product Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:34] Carlos Patel (Solution Engineer):
Good morning. Carlos Patel, Solution Engineer. I've been working closely with the Pioneer Tech team on the pre-work for this.

[00:40] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:51] Carlos Patel (Solution Engineer):

[00:58] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:04] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:15] Carlos Patel (Solution Engineer):
Our risk models run in batch overnight but the market moves in real time. We need intraday risk recalculation to stay competitive.

[01:36] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:48] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[02:05] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:19] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:31] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
Our fraud detection system has a 15% false positive rate which is costing us millions in manual review hours. We need to reduce that without increasing false negatives.

[02:53] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[03:07] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[03:27] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[04:31] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[04:49] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[05:08] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[05:25] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[05:41] Carlos Patel (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[05:59] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[06:18] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[06:34] Carlos Patel (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[06:50] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[07:12] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[07:30] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[07:50] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[08:11] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
On the PCI DSS front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[08:28] Carlos Patel (Solution Engineer):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[08:46] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[09:03] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[09:21] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
For the customer behavior analysis workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[09:38] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[09:53] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for customer behavior analysis. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[10:07] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[10:17] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[10:32] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[10:44] Brian Moore (Product Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[10:54] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[11:04] Ashley Okonkwo (Customer Success Manager):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[11:12] Chris Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #018 - Pioneer Tech (Retail)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~9 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Brian Harris and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Pioneer Tech.

[00:11] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:21] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Sarah Thompson, serving as Data Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:26] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
Hi everyone, Carlos Miller here. I'm the Solution Architect on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:33] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:44] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:52] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:58] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:09] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
Supply chain disruptions are taking us 3-4 days to detect. By then, empty shelves have already cost us significant revenue and customer goodwill.

[01:24] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:36] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[01:54] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:06] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:18] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
Our pricing team is making decisions based on weekly reports. Competitors are adjusting prices hourly and we're always a step behind.

[02:38] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[02:55] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:11] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:24] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:36] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:47] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
Users must be able to create and test pricing rules with A/B testing capabilities including geographic and demographic segmentation.

[04:08] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[04:25] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
The system must ingest point-of-sale data from 2,500 stores within 5 minutes of each transaction.

[04:44] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[04:57] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
The system must generate automated replenishment recommendations based on real-time inventory levels, lead times, and forecasted demand.

[05:14] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:27] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
We need a unified product catalog that reconciles SKUs across all channels with support for product hierarchy and attribute management.

[05:46] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[06:00] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:14] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
The system must maintain data freshness of 15 minutes or less for inventory positions across all stores.

[06:34] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[06:52] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
The customer data platform must handle 50 million unique customer profiles with sub-second lookup times.

[07:12] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[07:24] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
The system must support 99.9% availability during store operating hours with maintenance windows limited to 2 AM - 5 AM local time.

[07:45] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:00] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
The demand forecasting engine must process predictions for 500,000 SKUs across all locations within a 2-hour batch window.

[08:15] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:27] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:36] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[08:48] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:01] Carlos Miller (Solution Architect):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:14] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:26] Sarah Thompson (Data Engineer):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[09:32] Brian Harris (Solution Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #019 - Sterling Manufacturing (Manufacturing)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~14 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Architecture Review
================================================================================

[00:00] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Matthew Taylor and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Sterling Manufacturing.

[00:10] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:20] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, Michelle Nakamura here. I'm the Data Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:26] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning. Tom Clark, Customer Success Manager. I've been working closely with the Sterling Manufacturing team on the pre-work for this.

[00:34] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:45] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:52] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:57] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[01:11] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[01:25] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[01:44] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
For the operational efficiency workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[02:06] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[02:21] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[02:42] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):

[04:22] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[04:40] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[05:02] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[05:19] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[05:35] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[05:47] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[06:07] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[06:21] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[06:41] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[06:58] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[07:12] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[07:25] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[07:44] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[07:58] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
On the quality control front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[08:14] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[08:27] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[08:35] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must support digital twin modeling for at least 200 pieces of critical equipment with real-time state synchronization.

[08:54] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[09:11] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must support integration with MES, ERP, and SCADA systems through configurable connectors.

[09:27] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[09:43] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Users must be able to define custom anomaly detection rules combining sensor thresholds, temporal patterns, and equipment context.

[09:59] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[10:13] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
We need a production scheduling optimizer that accounts for equipment availability, material constraints, and order priorities.

[10:29] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[10:47] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[10:57] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
System must support edge computing deployment for latency-sensitive use cases with eventual consistency to the central platform.

[11:16] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[11:34] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must operate in air-gapped environments with no internet connectivity for classified production facilities.

[11:49] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[12:07] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Anomaly detection alerts must fire within 5 seconds of the triggering sensor reading.

[12:23] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[12:41] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The system must retain raw sensor data for 90 days in hot storage and 5 years in cold storage with seamless query across tiers.

[12:59] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[13:16] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[13:24] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[13:35] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[13:50] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[14:05] Tom Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[14:15] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[14:26] Michelle Nakamura (Data Engineer):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[14:33] Matthew Taylor (Technical Lead):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #020 - CloudScale (Technology)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~15 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Carlos Harris and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for CloudScale.

[00:08] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:17] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Jennifer Moore, serving as Data Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:25] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
Hi everyone, Lisa Lee here. I'm the Product Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:30] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
Hi, Aisha Thompson here, Solution Architect. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:36] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:44] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:51] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:56] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:10] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
We've got 15 different microservices each with their own data store and there's no way to answer cross-service business questions without a week-long data engineering project.

[01:29] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:41] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[02:03] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:16] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:27] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
Developer onboarding for our data platform takes 3 weeks. The tooling is so complex that engineers spend more time fighting infrastructure than writing analytics logic.

[02:42] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[02:58] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:14] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:30] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:43] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:54] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
We need automated data pipeline monitoring with SLA tracking, freshness alerts, and dependency-aware failure notifications.

[04:10] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[04:24] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
The system must support multi-tenant data isolation with configurable compute and storage quotas per tenant.

[04:42] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[04:59] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
We need automated feature flag integration that correlates experiment assignments with behavioral outcomes across the full conversion funnel.

[05:18] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:31] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
The platform must provide a self-service query interface where product managers can explore data without writing SQL.

[05:52] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[06:08] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:20] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
Data encryption must be enforced at rest and in transit with customer-managed encryption keys for enterprise tenants.

[06:37] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[06:55] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
The system must support blue-green deployments with zero-downtime upgrades.

[07:15] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:32] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
The platform must support at least 200 concurrent analytical users without query queueing.

[07:53] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[08:05] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
Event ingestion must handle 500,000 events per second at peak with less than 100ms end-to-end latency.

[08:26] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[08:40] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[08:57] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[09:11] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[09:33] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[09:47] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[10:03] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
On the API performance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[10:19] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[10:40] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[10:59] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[11:16] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[11:30] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
For the product analytics workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[11:46] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[11:58] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[12:12] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for product analytics. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[12:27] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[12:42] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[12:56] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[13:14] Aisha Thompson (Solution Architect):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[13:31] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[13:46] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[14:00] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[14:12] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[14:27] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[14:41] Lisa Lee (Product Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[14:51] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[15:04] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[15:13] Jennifer Moore (Data Engineer):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[15:22] Carlos Harris (Customer Success Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #021 - Apex Solutions (Healthcare)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Sarah Harris and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Apex Solutions.

[00:09] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:15] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Hi, Amanda Patel here, Customer Success Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:20] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
Good morning. Ashley Nakamura, Product Manager. I've been working closely with the Apex Solutions team on the pre-work for this.

[00:26] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:34] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:40] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:48] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:02] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
Our population health models are running on stale data - sometimes 48 hours old. By the time we identify at-risk patients, interventions are already too late.

[01:21] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[01:34] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[01:49] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:06] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:17] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
We failed our last HIPAA audit because we couldn't demonstrate proper data lineage. We need to know exactly where patient data flows and who accessed it.

[02:39] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[02:53] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:13] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:31] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[03:50] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[04:11] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[04:24] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[04:39] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[04:56] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[05:12] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[05:26] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[05:40] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about the architecture for clinical decision support. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[06:02] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[06:15] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
On the patient data security front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[06:31] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
For the clinical decision support workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[06:46] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[07:03] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[07:24] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[07:45] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[07:58] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[08:17] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[08:32] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[08:52] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[09:04] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[09:15] Ashley Nakamura (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:26] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:38] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:48] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[10:01] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[10:10] Amanda Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[10:19] Sarah Harris (Solution Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #022 - Summit Technologies (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Matthew Harris and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Summit Technologies.

[00:08] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:15] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
Hi, Kevin Harris here, Data Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:20] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Nicole Martin, serving as Solution Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:28] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
Hey team, I'm David Johnson, serving as Solution Architect. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:34] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:44] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:53] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:58] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:11] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
Regulators are requiring us to demonstrate model explainability for all credit scoring decisions. Our current ML pipeline is essentially a black box.

[01:27] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:40] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[01:58] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:10] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:22] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Our risk models run in batch overnight but the market moves in real time. We need intraday risk recalculation to stay competitive.

[02:44] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[02:57] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:19] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:36] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:48] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:59] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
The system must generate regulatory reports in formats compliant with Basel III, MiFID II, and Dodd-Frank requirements.

[04:18] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[04:35] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
All ML model outputs must include feature importance scores and decision explanations in human-readable format for regulatory review.

[04:53] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:08] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
Users must be able to define custom risk scenarios and run Monte Carlo simulations on demand.

[05:28] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:40] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
The system must support real-time transaction scoring with the ability to process at least 10,000 transactions per second.

[06:00] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[06:12] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:26] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
The platform must achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance within 6 months of deployment.

[06:44] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[07:01] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
The system must support concurrent access by at least 500 analysts without performance degradation.

[07:22] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:35] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Transaction scoring must complete within 50 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.

[07:53] Kevin Harris (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:05] David Johnson (Solution Architect):
The platform must support data residency requirements across multiple jurisdictions including EU, US, and APAC.

[08:26] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:39] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:47] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:01] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:13] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:25] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:38] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:46] Nicole Martin (Solution Engineer):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[09:55] Matthew Harris (Product Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

================================================================================

[00:00] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Aisha Thomas and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Horizon Enterprises.

[00:08] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:16] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Hey team, I'm Carlos Johnson, serving as Customer Success Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:24] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
Good morning. Michael Harris, Product Manager. I've been working closely with the Horizon Enterprises team on the pre-work for this.

[00:32] Wei Davis (Solution Engineer):
Hi, Wei Davis here, Solution Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[01:13] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[01:27] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
For the customer segmentation workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[01:49] Wei Davis (Solution Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[02:03] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[02:19] Wei Davis (Solution Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[02:35] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[02:55] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[03:11] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[03:28] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[03:43] Wei Davis (Solution Engineer):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[04:03] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[04:17] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
On the customer experience front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[04:36] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for customer segmentation. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[04:57] Michael Harris (Product Manager):

[05:34] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[05:54] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[06:11] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[06:27] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[06:40] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[06:52] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
Users must be able to create and test pricing rules with A/B testing capabilities including geographic and demographic segmentation.

[07:11] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[07:28] Wei Davis (Solution Engineer):
The platform must support customer identity resolution across online, mobile app, in-store, and loyalty program touchpoints.

[07:43] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[08:00] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
The system must ingest point-of-sale data from 2,500 stores within 5 minutes of each transaction.

[08:20] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[08:38] Wei Davis (Solution Engineer):
The platform must support what-if scenario modeling for promotional campaigns including cannibalization effects.

[09:00] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[09:17] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[09:27] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
The system must maintain data freshness of 15 minutes or less for inventory positions across all stores.

[09:46] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[10:01] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
Platform must support a Black Friday traffic spike of 20x normal volume without service degradation.

[10:16] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[10:30] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
The system must support 99.9% availability during store operating hours with maintenance windows limited to 2 AM - 5 AM local time.

[10:51] Wei Davis (Solution Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[11:07] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
All PII must be handled in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and applicable regional privacy regulations.

[11:25] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[11:43] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[11:53] Carlos Johnson (Customer Success Manager):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[12:04] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[12:17] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[12:29] Aisha Thomas (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[12:39] Michael Harris (Product Manager):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[00:41] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
Hi, Sarah Davis here, Technical Lead. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:47] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:59] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:07] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:14] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:27] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
We're collecting 2TB of IoT data per day from the factory floor but only analyzing about 5% of it. The rest just sits in cold storage because we don't have the tools to process it.

[01:49] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[02:04] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[02:24] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:37] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:48] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
Our quality defect rate has climbed to 3.2% and we can't trace root causes because production data and quality data live in completely separate systems.

[03:04] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[03:16] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[03:31] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:47] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[04:00] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:10] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
We need a production scheduling optimizer that accounts for equipment availability, material constraints, and order priorities.

[04:32] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[04:47] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
Users must be able to define custom anomaly detection rules combining sensor thresholds, temporal patterns, and equipment context.

[05:03] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:18] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must support digital twin modeling for at least 200 pieces of critical equipment with real-time state synchronization.

[05:37] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:49] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
The platform must support integration with MES, ERP, and SCADA systems through configurable connectors.

[06:08] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:26] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:36] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
The platform must operate in air-gapped environments with no internet connectivity for classified production facilities.

[06:54] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[07:06] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
Anomaly detection alerts must fire within 5 seconds of the triggering sensor reading.

[07:21] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:35] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must achieve 99.99% uptime for the real-time monitoring subsystem.

[07:56] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:14] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
System must support edge computing deployment for latency-sensitive use cases with eventual consistency to the central platform.

[08:33] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:46] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[09:02] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[09:20] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[09:36] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[09:50] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[10:07] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[10:26] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
On the IoT integration front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[10:40] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[10:55] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[11:16] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[11:30] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[11:51] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[12:04] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[12:18] Aisha Jones (Customer Success Manager):
For the operational efficiency workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[12:40] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[12:53] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[13:07] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[13:20] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[13:41] Tom Garcia (Product Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[13:58] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[14:20] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[14:37] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[14:47] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[15:00] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[15:11] Amanda Davis (Data Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[15:25] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[15:36] Sarah Davis (Technical Lead):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[15:43] Wei Brown (Solution Architect):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

[00:59] Aisha Jackson (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:10] Tom Miller (Solution Architect):
Developer onboarding for our data platform takes 3 weeks. The tooling is so complex that engineers spend more time fighting infrastructure than writing analytics logic.

[01:31] Lisa Chen (Solution Engineer):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:49] Aisha Jackson (Data Engineer):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[02:08] Tom Miller (Solution Architect):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:24] Aisha Jackson (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:33] Lisa Chen (Solution Engineer):
Our current data platform can't handle multi-tenant isolation properly. One large customer's queries regularly slow down the entire system for everyone else.

[02:50] Tom Miller (Solution Architect):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[03:06] Lisa Chen (Solution Engineer):

[05:32] Tom Miller (Solution Architect):

[05:50] Aisha Jackson (Data Engineer):
For the feature experimentation workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[06:12] Tom Miller (Solution Architect):

[00:23] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
Hi everyone, Brian Taylor here. I'm the Solution Architect on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:30] Brian Anderson (Technical Lead):
Good morning. Brian Anderson, Technical Lead. I've been working closely with the TechVenture Inc team on the pre-work for this.

[00:36] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:45] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):

[01:00] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:15] Brian Anderson (Technical Lead):
Our population health models are running on stale data - sometimes 48 hours old. By the time we identify at-risk patients, interventions are already too late.

[01:36] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[01:48] Brian Anderson (Technical Lead):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[02:07] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:21] Kevin Chen (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:33] Kevin Chen (Product Manager):
We failed our last HIPAA audit because we couldn't demonstrate proper data lineage. We need to know exactly where patient data flows and who accessed it.

[02:55] Kevin Chen (Product Manager):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[03:11] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:33] Kevin Chen (Product Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[03:45] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:59] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:11] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
Users must be able to build custom clinical dashboards without engineering support, using a drag-and-drop interface.

[04:26] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[04:44] Brian Anderson (Technical Lead):
The system must generate automated alerts when patient risk scores exceed configurable thresholds.

[05:04] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:18] Kevin Chen (Product Manager):
All data transformations must produce an auditable lineage trail showing source-to-destination data flow.

[05:36] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:49] Brian Anderson (Technical Lead):
The system must support real-time ingestion from HL7 FHIR endpoints with sub-second latency for critical patient events.

[06:11] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:27] Kevin Chen (Product Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:40] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
Dashboard queries must return results within 2 seconds for datasets up to 50 million records.

[07:00] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:18] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
System must be able to scale horizontally to handle a 10x increase in data volume over the next 3 years without architectural changes.

[07:33] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:49] Kevin Chen (Product Manager):
The platform must support role-based access control with at least 15 distinct permission levels aligned to clinical roles.

[08:09] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[08:26] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
Disaster recovery must support an RPO of 1 hour and an RTO of 4 hours.

[08:45] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[09:01] Aisha Harris (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[09:12] Brian Taylor (Solution Architect):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[02:14] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[02:31] Rachel Brown (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about the architecture for portfolio optimization. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[02:51] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[03:11] Rachel Brown (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[03:26] Rachel Brown (Solution Architect):

[04:16] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[04:30] Rachel Brown (Solution Architect):
On the regulatory compliance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[04:45] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[04:57] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[05:16] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[05:38] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[05:53] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[06:05] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[06:17] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
All ML model outputs must include feature importance scores and decision explanations in human-readable format for regulatory review.

[06:35] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:48] Rachel Brown (Solution Architect):
The system must support real-time transaction scoring with the ability to process at least 10,000 transactions per second.

[07:04] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[07:21] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
We need full audit logging of every data access, transformation, and model execution with tamper-proof storage.

[07:40] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[07:57] Rachel Brown (Solution Architect):
The system must generate regulatory reports in formats compliant with Basel III, MiFID II, and Dodd-Frank requirements.

[08:16] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[08:32] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[08:46] Rachel Brown (Solution Architect):
All data must be retained for a minimum of 7 years in compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations.

[09:02] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[09:20] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance within 6 months of deployment.

[09:36] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[09:53] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
System failover must complete within 30 seconds with zero data loss for in-flight transactions.

[10:09] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[10:26] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
The system must support concurrent access by at least 500 analysts without performance degradation.

[10:42] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[10:54] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[11:04] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[11:18] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[11:29] Robert Lee (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[11:39] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[11:51] Brian Nakamura (Customer Success Manager):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[12:00] Jessica Chen (Solution Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #028 - Sterling Manufacturing (Retail)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~16 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Chris Patel and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Sterling Manufacturing.

[00:11] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Hi everyone, Rachel Thompson here. I'm the Product Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:25] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Hi everyone, Daniel Moore here. I'm the Technical Lead on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:30] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:42] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:51] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:59] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:09] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Supply chain disruptions are taking us 3-4 days to detect. By then, empty shelves have already cost us significant revenue and customer goodwill.

[01:27] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:44] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[02:06] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:19] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:28] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
We're losing $2M per quarter in markdowns because our demand forecasting is off by 20-30%. We're either overstocked or out of stock on key SKUs.

[02:50] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[03:04] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:26] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:39] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:55] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:04] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Users must be able to create and test pricing rules with A/B testing capabilities including geographic and demographic segmentation.

[04:23] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[04:39] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
We need a unified product catalog that reconciles SKUs across all channels with support for product hierarchy and attribute management.

[04:56] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:11] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
The platform must support what-if scenario modeling for promotional campaigns including cannibalization effects.

[05:28] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:43] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
The system must ingest point-of-sale data from 2,500 stores within 5 minutes of each transaction.

[06:01] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:18] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:28] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
The demand forecasting engine must process predictions for 500,000 SKUs across all locations within a 2-hour batch window.

[06:45] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:00] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
The system must maintain data freshness of 15 minutes or less for inventory positions across all stores.

[07:20] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:32] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
The customer data platform must handle 50 million unique customer profiles with sub-second lookup times.

[07:52] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:10] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Platform must support a Black Friday traffic spike of 20x normal volume without service degradation.

[08:25] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[08:43] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[09:04] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[09:20] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[09:35] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[09:55] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[10:13] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[10:31] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[10:52] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[11:04] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
On the real-time data front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[11:19] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[11:37] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[11:51] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[12:04] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
For the customer segmentation workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[12:25] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[12:41] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[12:56] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[13:12] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[13:27] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[13:43] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[14:02] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[14:17] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[14:31] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[14:53] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[15:08] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[15:22] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[15:34] Daniel Moore (Technical Lead):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[15:44] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[15:55] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[16:05] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[16:16] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[16:25] Rachel Thompson (Product Manager):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[16:32] Chris Patel (Solution Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #029 - Innovate Solutions (Manufacturing)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Lisa Martinez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Innovate Solutions.

[00:08] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:16] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning. Jennifer Davis, Customer Success Manager. I've been working closely with the Innovate Solutions team on the pre-work for this.

[00:23] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
Hi, Daniel Clark here, Solution Architect. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:28] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:40] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:46] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:54] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:07] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Our quality defect rate has climbed to 3.2% and we can't trace root causes because production data and quality data live in completely separate systems.

[01:29] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[01:41] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[01:59] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:12] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:21] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Our supply chain planning still relies on spreadsheets. When a supplier misses a delivery, it takes 2 days to understand the downstream impact on production schedules.

[02:43] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[02:59] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:21] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:34] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[03:53] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[04:07] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about the architecture for production analytics. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[04:24] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[04:41] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[04:53] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[05:13] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[05:35] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):

We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[07:47] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[08:01] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[08:16] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):

[08:56] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[09:08] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[09:26] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[09:34] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:44] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:57] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[10:08] Lisa Martinez (Technical Lead):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[10:18] Jennifer Davis (Customer Success Manager):
Nothing from my side. Appreciate everyone's time. Looking forward to the next steps.

CALL #030 - Pioneer Tech (Technology)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~9 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Jessica Davis and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Pioneer Tech.

[00:09] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] James Williams (Solution Engineer):
Hi, James Williams here, Solution Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:23] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning. Jennifer Brown, Customer Success Manager. I've been working closely with the Pioneer Tech team on the pre-work for this.

[00:29] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
Hi, Priya Anderson here, Technical Lead. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:37] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:47] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:57] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:03] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:14] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
We've got 15 different microservices each with their own data store and there's no way to answer cross-service business questions without a week-long data engineering project.

[01:29] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[01:43] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[02:01] James Williams (Solution Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:16] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:28] James Williams (Solution Engineer):
Developer onboarding for our data platform takes 3 weeks. The tooling is so complex that engineers spend more time fighting infrastructure than writing analytics logic.

[02:44] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[02:56] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[03:12] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:29] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:41] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:50] James Williams (Solution Engineer):
The platform must provide a self-service query interface where product managers can explore data without writing SQL.

[04:09] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[04:21] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
We need automated data pipeline monitoring with SLA tracking, freshness alerts, and dependency-aware failure notifications.

[04:36] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[04:52] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
We need automated feature flag integration that correlates experiment assignments with behavioral outcomes across the full conversion funnel.

[05:10] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:28] James Williams (Solution Engineer):
The system must support multi-tenant data isolation with configurable compute and storage quotas per tenant.

[05:50] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:05] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:16] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
Query response times for standard dashboards must be under 3 seconds for 95th percentile.

[06:36] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[06:49] James Williams (Solution Engineer):
The system must support blue-green deployments with zero-downtime upgrades.

[07:11] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[07:25] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
Event ingestion must handle 500,000 events per second at peak with less than 100ms end-to-end latency.

[07:45] James Williams (Solution Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[07:57] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
Data encryption must be enforced at rest and in transit with customer-managed encryption keys for enterprise tenants.

[08:14] Jennifer Brown (Customer Success Manager):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:27] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:36] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[08:51] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:03] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:18] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:30] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:42] Priya Anderson (Technical Lead):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[09:50] Jessica Davis (Solution Architect):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #031 - Acme Corp (Healthcare)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~13 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Architecture Review
================================================================================

[00:00] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Daniel Rodriguez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Acme Corp.

[00:09] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:19] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Hi, Amanda Taylor here, Customer Success Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:27] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Good morning. Wei Martin, Data Engineer. I've been working closely with the Acme Corp team on the pre-work for this.

[00:35] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:44] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:51] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:57] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
On the EHR integration front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[01:16] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[01:37] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[01:51] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[02:13] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[02:28] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[02:44] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[03:05] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[03:19] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[03:33] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[03:50] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about the architecture for population health management. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[04:04] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[04:20] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[04:36] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[04:55] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[05:15] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
For the population health management workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[05:36] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[05:53] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[06:15] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[06:30] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[06:52] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[07:05] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[07:16] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Users must be able to build custom clinical dashboards without engineering support, using a drag-and-drop interface.

[07:33] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[07:45] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
We need the ability to run federated queries across all five EHR data sources as if they were a single dataset.

[08:02] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[08:19] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
The system must support real-time ingestion from HL7 FHIR endpoints with sub-second latency for critical patient events.

[08:41] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[08:58] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
The platform must support automated patient cohort generation based on configurable clinical criteria including ICD-10 codes, lab results, and medication history.

[09:16] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[09:29] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[09:40] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using AES-256 and TLS 1.3 respectively.

[09:58] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[10:16] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
The system must comply with HIPAA, HITECH, and state-level privacy regulations simultaneously.

[10:32] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[10:50] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Dashboard queries must return results within 2 seconds for datasets up to 50 million records.

[11:12] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[11:28] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
System must be able to scale horizontally to handle a 10x increase in data volume over the next 3 years without architectural changes.

[11:50] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[12:07] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[12:15] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[12:29] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[12:44] Wei Martin (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[12:59] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[13:11] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[13:20] Amanda Taylor (Customer Success Manager):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[13:27] Daniel Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #032 - Pioneer Tech (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~16 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm James Anderson and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Pioneer Tech.

[00:08] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:17] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Hi, Robert Jackson here, Solution Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:22] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Hi, Ashley Martin here, Customer Success Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:30] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):
Hi, Amanda Garcia here, Solution Architect. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:38] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
Good morning. David Anderson, Technical Lead. I've been working closely with the Pioneer Tech team on the pre-work for this.

[00:44] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:55] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:05] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:11] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:24] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):
We're processing trades across 12 different asset classes and the reconciliation process takes 6 hours. By the time discrepancies are found, settlement windows have closed.

[01:41] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:58] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[02:16] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:29] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:38] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Our risk models run in batch overnight but the market moves in real time. We need intraday risk recalculation to stay competitive.

[02:54] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[03:09] James Anderson (Product Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:25] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:38] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:51] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:03] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
The system must support real-time transaction scoring with the ability to process at least 10,000 transactions per second.

[04:19] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[04:33] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
Users must be able to define custom risk scenarios and run Monte Carlo simulations on demand.

[04:53] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:09] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
We need full audit logging of every data access, transformation, and model execution with tamper-proof storage.

[05:30] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[05:42] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
All ML model outputs must include feature importance scores and decision explanations in human-readable format for regulatory review.

[05:59] James Anderson (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:13] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:26] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
All data must be retained for a minimum of 7 years in compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations.

[06:48] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:00] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
The platform must support data residency requirements across multiple jurisdictions including EU, US, and APAC.

[07:16] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[07:32] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):
The platform must achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance within 6 months of deployment.

[07:50] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:06] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
The system must support concurrent access by at least 500 analysts without performance degradation.

[08:27] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:39] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[08:55] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):

[09:23] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[09:39] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[09:53] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[10:11] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[10:26] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[10:43] David Anderson (Technical Lead):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[11:03] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[11:17] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[11:31] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[12:39] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[12:56] James Anderson (Product Manager):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[13:15] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[13:29] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about the architecture for anti-money laundering. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[13:43] James Anderson (Product Manager):
For the anti-money laundering workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[14:00] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[14:35] Amanda Garcia (Solution Architect):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[14:57] James Anderson (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[15:07] James Anderson (Product Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[15:19] James Anderson (Product Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[15:34] Ashley Martin (Customer Success Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[15:47] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[15:55] Robert Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Nothing from my side. Appreciate everyone's time. Looking forward to the next steps.

[16:03] James Anderson (Product Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Duration: ~9 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] James Garcia (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm James Garcia and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Cobalt Technologies.

[00:12] James Garcia (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:20] Tom Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Hi everyone, Tom Thompson here. I'm the Customer Success Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:28] Jessica Miller (Technical Lead):
Hi everyone, Jessica Miller here. I'm the Technical Lead on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:36] Jessica Thomas (Data Engineer):
Hi, Jessica Thomas here, Data Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:44] James Okonkwo (Solution Engineer):
Hi everyone, James Okonkwo here. I'm the Solution Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:51] James Garcia (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:59] Tom Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:09] James Garcia (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:17] James Garcia (Product Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:28] Jessica Thomas (Data Engineer):
Our pricing team is making decisions based on weekly reports. Competitors are adjusting prices hourly and we're always a step behind.

[01:44] James Okonkwo (Solution Engineer):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:58] Jessica Miller (Technical Lead):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[02:34] Jessica Miller (Technical Lead):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:43] Tom Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
We're losing $2M per quarter in markdowns because our demand forecasting is off by 20-30%. We're either overstocked or out of stock on key SKUs.

[02:59] Jessica Miller (Technical Lead):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[03:15] James Okonkwo (Solution Engineer):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:37] James Garcia (Product Manager):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:51] Tom Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[04:13] James Okonkwo (Solution Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[04:33] Tom Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[04:50] James Garcia (Product Manager):

I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[06:39] Tom Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[06:54] James Garcia (Product Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[07:13] Jessica Thomas (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[07:28] Jessica Thomas (Data Engineer):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[07:45] James Garcia (Product Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[08:07] James Okonkwo (Solution Engineer):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[08:25] James Garcia (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:35] Jessica Thomas (Data Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[08:46] Jessica Thomas (Data Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[08:58] James Okonkwo (Solution Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:09] Jessica Thomas (Data Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:22] James Garcia (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:33] Tom Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Nothing from my side. Appreciate everyone's time. Looking forward to the next steps.

[09:42] James Garcia (Product Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Lisa Chen and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Apex Solutions.

[00:09] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
Hi, Kevin Harris here, Solution Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:25] Emily Clark (Product Manager):
Hey team, I'm Emily Clark, serving as Product Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:33] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
Hi everyone, Daniel Clark here. I'm the Solution Architect on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:41] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Hi everyone, Matthew Clark here. I'm the Customer Success Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:46] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:56] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:06] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:11] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:24] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
We're collecting 2TB of IoT data per day from the factory floor but only analyzing about 5% of it. The rest just sits in cold storage because we don't have the tools to process it.

[01:45] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[01:58] Emily Clark (Product Manager):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[02:20] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:38] Emily Clark (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:46] Emily Clark (Product Manager):
Our quality defect rate has climbed to 3.2% and we can't trace root causes because production data and quality data live in completely separate systems.

[03:07] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[03:22] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:43] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[03:58] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[04:13] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:25] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
Users must be able to define custom anomaly detection rules combining sensor thresholds, temporal patterns, and equipment context.

[04:42] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[04:57] Emily Clark (Product Manager):
The system must provide automated root cause analysis that correlates quality defects with upstream process parameters within 30 seconds.

[05:19] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:33] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
The system must ingest and process streaming data from 50,000 IoT sensors with support for OPC UA, MQTT, and Modbus protocols.

[05:52] Emily Clark (Product Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[06:09] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
The platform must support integration with MES, ERP, and SCADA systems through configurable connectors.

[06:28] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[06:40] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:52] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
The platform must operate in air-gapped environments with no internet connectivity for classified production facilities.

[07:13] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:26] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
IoT data ingestion must support sustained throughput of 1 million events per second with at-most-once delivery guarantees.

[07:41] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:59] Emily Clark (Product Manager):
The platform must achieve 99.99% uptime for the real-time monitoring subsystem.

[08:21] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:37] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
Anomaly detection alerts must fire within 5 seconds of the triggering sensor reading.

[08:53] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[09:05] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[09:13] Daniel Clark (Solution Architect):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:27] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:40] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:54] Matthew Clark (Customer Success Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[10:07] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[10:19] Kevin Harris (Solution Engineer):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[10:26] Lisa Chen (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #035 - Apex Solutions (Technology)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~13 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Architecture Review
================================================================================

[00:00] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Brian Miller and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Apex Solutions.

[00:12] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:22] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Good morning. Brian Brown, Solution Architect. I've been working closely with the Apex Solutions team on the pre-work for this.

[00:27] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Ashley Taylor, serving as Data Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:32] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:43] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:50] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:55] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[01:17] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[01:36] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[01:54] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[02:12] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[02:30] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
For the feature experimentation workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[02:48] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[03:06] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about the architecture for feature experimentation. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[03:28] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[03:48] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[04:00] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[04:19] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[04:35] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
On the scalability front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[04:56] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[05:13] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[05:29] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[05:46] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[06:01] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[06:21] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[06:39] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[06:53] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[07:03] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
The system must support multi-tenant data isolation with configurable compute and storage quotas per tenant.

[07:20] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[07:37] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
The system must support real-time event streaming with exactly-once semantics for product analytics events.

[07:57] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[08:09] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
The platform must provide a self-service query interface where product managers can explore data without writing SQL.

[08:28] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[08:45] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
We need automated feature flag integration that correlates experiment assignments with behavioral outcomes across the full conversion funnel.

[09:06] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[09:22] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[09:34] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Data encryption must be enforced at rest and in transit with customer-managed encryption keys for enterprise tenants.

[09:49] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[10:07] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
Event ingestion must handle 500,000 events per second at peak with less than 100ms end-to-end latency.

[10:28] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[10:45] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
The system must support blue-green deployments with zero-downtime upgrades.

[11:05] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[11:23] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
New data source onboarding must be completable by a developer in under 4 hours including schema definition and pipeline setup.

[11:43] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[11:58] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[12:07] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[12:17] Brian Brown (Solution Architect):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[12:30] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[12:40] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[12:50] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[12:59] Ashley Taylor (Data Engineer):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[13:05] Brian Miller (Product Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #036 - Quantum Systems (Healthcare)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~15 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm James Brown and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Quantum Systems.

[00:12] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Hi, Michelle Anderson here, Product Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:25] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
Good morning. Carlos Williams, Technical Lead. I've been working closely with the Quantum Systems team on the pre-work for this.

[00:31] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:41] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:50] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:55] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:07] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Our population health models are running on stale data - sometimes 48 hours old. By the time we identify at-risk patients, interventions are already too late.

[01:25] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[01:40] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[01:57] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:13] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:21] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Our current analytics platform can't handle the volume of patient records we're processing. We're seeing 30-second query times on dashboards that clinicians need in real time.

[02:43] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[02:58] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:17] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[03:33] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:45] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:55] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
All data transformations must produce an auditable lineage trail showing source-to-destination data flow.

[04:15] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[04:30] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
The platform must support automated patient cohort generation based on configurable clinical criteria including ICD-10 codes, lab results, and medication history.

[04:49] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:03] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
The system must support real-time ingestion from HL7 FHIR endpoints with sub-second latency for critical patient events.

[05:20] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:36] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Users must be able to build custom clinical dashboards without engineering support, using a drag-and-drop interface.

[05:58] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[06:14] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:27] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
Disaster recovery must support an RPO of 1 hour and an RTO of 4 hours.

[06:48] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[07:03] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using AES-256 and TLS 1.3 respectively.

[07:24] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:41] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Dashboard queries must return results within 2 seconds for datasets up to 50 million records.

[07:59] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[08:12] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
System must be able to scale horizontally to handle a 10x increase in data volume over the next 3 years without architectural changes.

[08:28] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[08:40] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[09:01] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[09:23] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[09:39] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[09:57] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[10:13] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[10:30] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[10:43] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[11:04] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[11:20] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[11:37] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[11:58] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[12:30] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[12:44] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
For the clinical decision support workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[13:02] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[13:17] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[13:31] Carlos Williams (Technical Lead):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[13:52] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
On the PHI handling front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[14:13] Michelle Anderson (Product Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[14:30] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[14:38] James Brown (Solution Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

CALL #037 - Pioneer Tech (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~9 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Amanda Martin and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Pioneer Tech.

[00:10] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Hi, Brian Miller here, Customer Success Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:23] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
Hey team, I'm Amanda Lee, serving as Solution Engineer. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:29] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:39] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:46] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:54] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:09] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Our risk models run in batch overnight but the market moves in real time. We need intraday risk recalculation to stay competitive.

[01:30] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[01:47] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[02:05] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:20] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:32] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
We're processing trades across 12 different asset classes and the reconciliation process takes 6 hours. By the time discrepancies are found, settlement windows have closed.

[02:52] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[03:05] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:21] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:37] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
For the portfolio optimization workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[03:53] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[04:15] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[04:37] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[04:58] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[05:15] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[05:34] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[05:49] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[06:07] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[06:22] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
Let's talk about the architecture for portfolio optimization. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[06:39] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[06:59] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[07:13] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[07:28] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[07:43] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[07:55] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[08:10] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[08:29] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:37] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[08:49] Brian Miller (Customer Success Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:01] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:14] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:24] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:33] Amanda Lee (Solution Engineer):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[09:40] Amanda Martin (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #038 - Fusion Analytics (Retail)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Chris Williams and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Fusion Analytics.

[00:08] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:16] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
Hi, Kevin Chen here, Customer Success Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:23] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
Hey team, I'm Emily Johnson, serving as Solution Architect. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:31] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
Good morning. Carlos Taylor, Data Engineer. I've been working closely with the Fusion Analytics team on the pre-work for this.

[00:38] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:49] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:56] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:04] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:18] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
We're losing $2M per quarter in markdowns because our demand forecasting is off by 20-30%. We're either overstocked or out of stock on key SKUs.

[01:38] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[01:53] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[02:13] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:25] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:34] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
Supply chain disruptions are taking us 3-4 days to detect. By then, empty shelves have already cost us significant revenue and customer goodwill.

[02:49] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[03:07] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:22] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:37] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:51] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:00] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
The system must generate automated replenishment recommendations based on real-time inventory levels, lead times, and forecasted demand.

[04:22] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[04:40] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
The platform must support customer identity resolution across online, mobile app, in-store, and loyalty program touchpoints.

[04:57] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:14] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
Users must be able to create and test pricing rules with A/B testing capabilities including geographic and demographic segmentation.

[05:33] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:50] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
The system must ingest point-of-sale data from 2,500 stores within 5 minutes of each transaction.

[06:10] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:27] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:37] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
The customer data platform must handle 50 million unique customer profiles with sub-second lookup times.

[06:55] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:12] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
Platform must support a Black Friday traffic spike of 20x normal volume without service degradation.

[07:30] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[07:46] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
The system must support 99.9% availability during store operating hours with maintenance windows limited to 2 AM - 5 AM local time.

[08:04] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:17] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
All PII must be handled in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and applicable regional privacy regulations.

[08:33] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[08:47] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:58] Emily Johnson (Solution Architect):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:08] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:21] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:34] Carlos Taylor (Data Engineer):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:44] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:52] Kevin Chen (Customer Success Manager):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[09:58] Chris Williams (Product Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

================================================================================

[00:00] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Brian Jackson and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Summit Technologies.

[00:12] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:22] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
Good morning. Daniel Johnson, Data Engineer. I've been working closely with the Summit Technologies team on the pre-work for this.

[00:29] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Hey team, I'm Brian Jackson, serving as Customer Success Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:36] Michael Chen (Solution Engineer):
Good morning. Michael Chen, Solution Engineer. I've been working closely with the Summit Technologies team on the pre-work for this.

[00:44] Michelle Harris (Solution Architect):
Hi everyone, Michelle Harris here. I'm the Solution Architect on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:51] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:08] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:15] Michael Chen (Solution Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[01:33] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[01:49] Michelle Harris (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[02:08] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[02:27] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[02:41] Michelle Harris (Solution Architect):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[02:53] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
For the yield optimization workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[03:11] Michelle Harris (Solution Architect):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[03:26] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[03:41] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[03:58] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):

[04:17] Michael Chen (Solution Engineer):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[04:33] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
On the digital twin accuracy front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[04:53] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[05:05] Michael Chen (Solution Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[05:25] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):

[05:59] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[06:10] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
The system must provide automated root cause analysis that correlates quality defects with upstream process parameters within 30 seconds.

[06:28] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[06:40] Michelle Harris (Solution Architect):
The platform must support integration with MES, ERP, and SCADA systems through configurable connectors.

[06:56] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[07:11] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
The system must ingest and process streaming data from 50,000 IoT sensors with support for OPC UA, MQTT, and Modbus protocols.

[07:28] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[07:43] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
We need a production scheduling optimizer that accounts for equipment availability, material constraints, and order priorities.

[08:04] Michael Chen (Solution Engineer):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[08:19] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[08:30] Michael Chen (Solution Engineer):
The system must retain raw sensor data for 90 days in hot storage and 5 years in cold storage with seamless query across tiers.

[08:50] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[09:06] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
Anomaly detection alerts must fire within 5 seconds of the triggering sensor reading.

[09:27] Brian Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[09:40] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
IoT data ingestion must support sustained throughput of 1 million events per second with at-most-once delivery guarantees.

[10:00] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[10:12] Michael Chen (Solution Engineer):
The platform must operate in air-gapped environments with no internet connectivity for classified production facilities.

[10:29] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[10:41] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[10:49] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[11:01] Daniel Johnson (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[11:12] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[11:23] Brian Jackson (Product Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[11:32] Michelle Harris (Solution Architect):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

CALL #040 - Vertex Group (Technology)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~16 minutes
Participants: 5
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Rachel Moore and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Vertex Group.

[00:11] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:21] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
Hi everyone, Nicole Brown here. I'm the Solution Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:27] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Hi everyone, Robert Rodriguez here. I'm the Product Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:33] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
Good morning. Lisa Harris, Solution Architect. I've been working closely with the Vertex Group team on the pre-work for this.

[00:39] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, Ashley White here. I'm the Data Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:44] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:52] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[01:01] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:09] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:24] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
Our current data platform can't handle multi-tenant isolation properly. One large customer's queries regularly slow down the entire system for everyone else.

[01:40] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:53] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[02:08] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:22] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:31] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
We've got 15 different microservices each with their own data store and there's no way to answer cross-service business questions without a week-long data engineering project.

[02:48] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[03:04] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:22] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:37] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:51] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:59] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
The platform must provide a self-service query interface where product managers can explore data without writing SQL.

[04:17] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[04:34] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
The platform must provide a unified semantic layer that abstracts across all 15 microservice data stores.

[04:53] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[05:05] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
The system must support multi-tenant data isolation with configurable compute and storage quotas per tenant.

[05:21] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[05:39] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
We need automated data pipeline monitoring with SLA tracking, freshness alerts, and dependency-aware failure notifications.

[05:59] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[06:16] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:29] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Event ingestion must handle 500,000 events per second at peak with less than 100ms end-to-end latency.

[06:48] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[07:03] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
Query response times for standard dashboards must be under 3 seconds for 95th percentile.

[07:18] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:36] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
The system must support blue-green deployments with zero-downtime upgrades.

[07:51] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[08:06] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
The platform must support at least 200 concurrent analytical users without query queueing.

[08:27] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[08:40] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[08:56] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[09:11] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[09:26] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[09:47] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[10:00] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
On the API performance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[10:15] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[10:27] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
For the system monitoring workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[10:45] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[10:59] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about the architecture for system monitoring. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[11:13] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[11:26] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[11:41] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[11:55] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[12:14] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[12:31] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[12:48] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[13:05] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[13:20] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[13:35] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[13:54] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[14:06] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[14:25] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[14:39] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[14:53] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[15:15] Lisa Harris (Solution Architect):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[15:30] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[15:44] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[15:53] Robert Rodriguez (Product Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[16:03] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[16:18] Nicole Brown (Solution Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[16:33] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[16:41] Ashley White (Data Engineer):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[16:48] Rachel Moore (Technical Lead):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #041 - NextGen Systems (Healthcare)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~11 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Matthew Patel and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for NextGen Systems.

[00:12] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:20] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
Good morning. Kevin Clark, Product Manager. I've been working closely with the NextGen Systems team on the pre-work for this.

[00:25] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
Good morning. Lisa Miller, Solution Architect. I've been working closely with the NextGen Systems team on the pre-work for this.

[00:30] Jennifer Davis (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, Jennifer Davis here. I'm the Data Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:36] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:45] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:53] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:58] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:09] Jennifer Davis (Data Engineer):
Our current analytics platform can't handle the volume of patient records we're processing. We're seeing 30-second query times on dashboards that clinicians need in real time.

[01:27] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:42] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[01:58] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:12] Jennifer Davis (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:20] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
We have data siloed across five different EHR systems and there's no unified view of patient journeys. Clinicians are making decisions with incomplete information.

[02:35] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[02:50] Jennifer Davis (Data Engineer):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:06] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:21] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
On the patient data security front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[03:39] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[03:58] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):

[04:14] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[04:29] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[04:44] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[05:04] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[05:18] Jennifer Davis (Data Engineer):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[05:37] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[05:57] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[06:09] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[06:45] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[07:01] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[07:19] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
For the care coordination workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[07:34] Lisa Miller (Solution Architect):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[07:50] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[10:20] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[10:28] Kevin Clark (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[10:39] Matthew Patel (Customer Success Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

CALL #042 - Apex Solutions (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm David Jones and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Apex Solutions.

[00:12] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
Hi everyone, Aisha Williams here. I'm the Technical Lead on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:26] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
Hi everyone, Ashley Thomas here. I'm the Solution Architect on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:31] Aisha White (Product Manager):
Hi everyone, Aisha White here. I'm the Product Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:39] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:50] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:59] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:07] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:17] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
Our risk models run in batch overnight but the market moves in real time. We need intraday risk recalculation to stay competitive.

[01:38] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:53] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[02:08] Aisha White (Product Manager):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:21] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:31] Aisha White (Product Manager):
Regulators are requiring us to demonstrate model explainability for all credit scoring decisions. Our current ML pipeline is essentially a black box.

[02:46] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[03:02] Aisha White (Product Manager):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[03:21] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:36] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:52] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:03] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
The platform must support multi-entity resolution across accounts, customers, and counterparties with configurable matching rules.

[04:19] Aisha White (Product Manager):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[04:36] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
Users must be able to define custom risk scenarios and run Monte Carlo simulations on demand.

[04:52] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:10] Aisha White (Product Manager):
The system must support real-time transaction scoring with the ability to process at least 10,000 transactions per second.

[05:28] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:43] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
All ML model outputs must include feature importance scores and decision explanations in human-readable format for regulatory review.

[06:04] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[06:16] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:30] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
The system must support concurrent access by at least 500 analysts without performance degradation.

[06:46] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[07:00] Aisha White (Product Manager):
Transaction scoring must complete within 50 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.

[07:20] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[07:35] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
All data must be retained for a minimum of 7 years in compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations.

[07:54] Aisha Williams (Technical Lead):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[08:11] Aisha White (Product Manager):
The platform must achieve SOC 2 Type II compliance within 6 months of deployment.

[08:33] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[08:48] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:58] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:12] Aisha White (Product Manager):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:26] Ashley Thomas (Solution Architect):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:38] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:50] Aisha White (Product Manager):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[09:56] David Jones (Solution Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Hi everyone, Robert Thomas here. I'm the Technical Lead on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:37] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
Hey team, I'm Priya Moore, serving as Product Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:45] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[01:40] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[01:56] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[02:10] Priya Thompson (Solution Architect):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[02:27] Aisha Brown (Customer Success Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[02:49] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[03:01] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[03:18] Aisha Brown (Customer Success Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[03:34] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[03:47] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[04:01] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
For the supply chain analytics workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[04:21] Aisha Brown (Customer Success Manager):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[04:43] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[04:55] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for supply chain analytics. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[05:17] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[05:33] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[05:49] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[05:58] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
The system must generate automated replenishment recommendations based on real-time inventory levels, lead times, and forecasted demand.

[06:17] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[06:29] Priya Thompson (Solution Architect):
The platform must support customer identity resolution across online, mobile app, in-store, and loyalty program touchpoints.

[06:51] Aisha Brown (Customer Success Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[07:06] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
The system must ingest point-of-sale data from 2,500 stores within 5 minutes of each transaction.

[07:28] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[07:41] Priya Thompson (Solution Architect):
We need a unified product catalog that reconciles SKUs across all channels with support for product hierarchy and attribute management.

[07:58] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[08:15] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[08:28] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
Platform must support a Black Friday traffic spike of 20x normal volume without service degradation.

[08:45] Priya Thompson (Solution Architect):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[09:00] Aisha Brown (Customer Success Manager):
The customer data platform must handle 50 million unique customer profiles with sub-second lookup times.

[09:21] Priya Thompson (Solution Architect):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[09:39] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
The system must support 99.9% availability during store operating hours with maintenance windows limited to 2 AM - 5 AM local time.

[09:54] Aisha Brown (Customer Success Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[10:12] Priya Thompson (Solution Architect):
All PII must be handled in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and applicable regional privacy regulations.

[10:27] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[10:42] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[10:50] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[11:05] Priya Moore (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[11:15] Robert Thomas (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[11:25] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[11:35] Priya Thompson (Solution Architect):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[11:45] Kevin Thompson (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #044 - Sterling Manufacturing (Manufacturing)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~16 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Aisha Jackson and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Sterling Manufacturing.

[00:09] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:15] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Hi, Rachel Chen here, Solution Architect. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:23] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
Hey team, I'm Matthew Jackson, serving as Product Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:29] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Hi, Carlos Brown here, Solution Engineer. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:37] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:46] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:54] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:02] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:13] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Our quality defect rate has climbed to 3.2% and we can't trace root causes because production data and quality data live in completely separate systems.

[01:28] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:43] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[01:59] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:12] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:21] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
We're collecting 2TB of IoT data per day from the factory floor but only analyzing about 5% of it. The rest just sits in cold storage because we don't have the tools to process it.

[02:41] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Walk me through a specific example. What does that look like day-to-day for your team?

[02:55] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:14] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:26] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:41] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:51] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
The platform must support integration with MES, ERP, and SCADA systems through configurable connectors.

[04:09] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[04:24] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Users must be able to define custom anomaly detection rules combining sensor thresholds, temporal patterns, and equipment context.

[04:45] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:00] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
We need a production scheduling optimizer that accounts for equipment availability, material constraints, and order priorities.

[05:21] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[05:39] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
The system must ingest and process streaming data from 50,000 IoT sensors with support for OPC UA, MQTT, and Modbus protocols.

[05:54] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:08] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:20] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
System must support edge computing deployment for latency-sensitive use cases with eventual consistency to the central platform.

[06:38] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[06:54] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
The system must retain raw sensor data for 90 days in hot storage and 5 years in cold storage with seamless query across tiers.

[07:11] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[07:23] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Anomaly detection alerts must fire within 5 seconds of the triggering sensor reading.

[07:40] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:55] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
The platform must achieve 99.99% uptime for the real-time monitoring subsystem.

[08:14] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[08:30] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[08:47] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[09:08] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
Let's talk about the architecture for operational efficiency. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[09:29] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
For the operational efficiency workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[09:50] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[10:07] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[10:29] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[10:45] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[11:00] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[11:15] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[11:28] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[11:46] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
On the quality control front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[12:05] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[12:23] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[12:41] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[12:56] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[13:10] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[13:25] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[13:43] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[14:05] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[14:21] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[14:36] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[14:47] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[15:01] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[15:15] Carlos Brown (Solution Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[15:30] Matthew Jackson (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[15:44] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[15:53] Rachel Chen (Solution Architect):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[16:03] Aisha Jackson (Customer Success Manager):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Matthew Williams and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Horizon Enterprises.

[00:09] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
Hi everyone, Matthew Martin here. I'm the Data Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:26] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
Hi everyone, Aisha Martin here. I'm the Product Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:32] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
Good morning. Michelle Jones, Technical Lead. I've been working closely with the Horizon Enterprises team on the pre-work for this.

[00:40] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:49] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:59] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:04] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:15] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
Our current data platform can't handle multi-tenant isolation properly. One large customer's queries regularly slow down the entire system for everyone else.

[01:30] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
Can you quantify the business impact of that? Like, what does that translate to in terms of revenue or operational cost?

[01:42] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[02:04] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
This is actually a great use case for Foundry IQ's ontology layer. By unifying the data model, we can eliminate a lot of those manual reconciliation steps.

[02:17] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:28] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
Developer onboarding for our data platform takes 3 weeks. The tooling is so complex that engineers spend more time fighting infrastructure than writing analytics logic.

[02:43] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[03:00] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:20] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[03:33] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[03:54] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[04:09] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[04:29] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[04:44] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[05:01] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[05:16] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[05:31] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[05:49] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[06:02] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[06:18] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[06:34] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[06:49] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
For the product analytics workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[07:10] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[07:26] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[07:47] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[08:04] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[08:19] Matthew Martin (Data Engineer):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[08:35] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[08:52] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[09:00] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:12] Aisha Martin (Product Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[09:26] Matthew Williams (Solution Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:39] Michelle Jones (Technical Lead):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

CALL #046 - CloudScale (Healthcare)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~9 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Carlos Clark and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for CloudScale.

[00:12] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
Hey team, I'm Wei Thomas, serving as Solution Architect. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:26] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
Hey team, I'm Carlos Harris, serving as Product Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:32] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:40] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:46] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:53] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:04] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
We failed our last HIPAA audit because we couldn't demonstrate proper data lineage. We need to know exactly where patient data flows and who accessed it.

[01:23] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
And that's with your current tooling? What are you using today for that workflow?

[01:35] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[01:56] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:10] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:18] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
We have data siloed across five different EHR systems and there's no unified view of patient journeys. Clinicians are making decisions with incomplete information.

[02:40] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[02:58] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
It's been building for about 18 months. We did a POC with another vendor last year but it didn't scale past the pilot phase. That's why we're looking at Foundry IQ now.

[03:20] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[03:33] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:46] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:55] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
The system must support real-time ingestion from HL7 FHIR endpoints with sub-second latency for critical patient events.

[04:12] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
Noted. I'll map that to the specific Foundry IQ modules we'll need to configure. That touches the ontology layer and possibly the Workshop application.

[04:25] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
Users must be able to build custom clinical dashboards without engineering support, using a drag-and-drop interface.

[04:43] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[04:57] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
The system must generate automated alerts when patient risk scores exceed configurable thresholds.

[05:13] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[05:28] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
The platform must support automated patient cohort generation based on configurable clinical criteria including ICD-10 codes, lab results, and medication history.

[05:47] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[06:02] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:12] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
Disaster recovery must support an RPO of 1 hour and an RTO of 4 hours.

[06:33] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[06:46] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
System must be able to scale horizontally to handle a 10x increase in data volume over the next 3 years without architectural changes.

[07:07] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:19] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using AES-256 and TLS 1.3 respectively.

[07:34] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:51] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
Dashboard queries must return results within 2 seconds for datasets up to 50 million records.

[08:13] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:30] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:42] Wei Thomas (Solution Architect):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[08:52] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
We need to finalize the data source inventory and get access credentials for the development environment.

[09:07] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:18] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[09:32] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:41] Carlos Harris (Product Manager):
Just want to say this was a great discussion. I feel much more confident about the Foundry IQ approach now.

[09:48] Carlos Clark (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #047 - NextGen Systems (Financial Services)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~13 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Architecture Review
================================================================================

[00:00] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Michelle Rodriguez and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for NextGen Systems.

[00:10] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:16] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
Hi, Sarah Lee here, Product Manager. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:24] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
Good morning. Robert Rodriguez, Customer Success Manager. I've been working closely with the NextGen Systems team on the pre-work for this.

[00:29] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Good morning. Michael Rodriguez, Solution Architect. I've been working closely with the NextGen Systems team on the pre-work for this.

[00:35] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:43] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:53] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:59] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
For the CI/CD pipeline, I'm recommending we use Foundry IQ's Checks framework to run automated data quality validations on every build before promoting to production.

[01:17] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
The transformation layer is where the heavy lifting happens. We'll use Foundry IQ's Code Repositories to write and version-control all our data transformations. Everything runs as managed Spark jobs.

[01:37] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[01:52] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[02:14] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
What about the API layer? We'll need external systems to both push data in and pull insights out. The Foundry IQ API supports both REST and GraphQL patterns.

[02:31] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[02:44] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Let's talk about the architecture for portfolio optimization. I'm proposing a three-tier approach within Foundry IQ: raw ingestion layer, a transformation layer, and then the ontology-backed application layer.

[03:04] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[03:22] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[03:44] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
We also need to plan for data lifecycle management. Not everything needs to live in hot storage forever. Foundry IQ supports tiered storage policies.

[04:04] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
One architecture decision we need to make is whether to use Foundry IQ's native compute or bring our own Kubernetes cluster. There are trade-offs either way.

[04:22] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
On the data governance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[04:39] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
For the portfolio optimization workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[04:58] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[05:12] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
Security architecture is critical here. I'm proposing we implement project-level RBAC, field-level access controls on the ontology, and network-level isolation for the production environment.

[05:28] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[05:45] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[06:01] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[06:19] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
For the application layer, I'm recommending we use Workshop to build the operational interfaces. It gives us the flexibility to create custom workflows without a full frontend development cycle.

[06:39] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[06:57] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[07:14] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[07:30] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[07:45] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[07:56] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
The system must support real-time transaction scoring with the ability to process at least 10,000 transactions per second.

[08:12] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[08:26] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Users must be able to define custom risk scenarios and run Monte Carlo simulations on demand.

[08:46] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[09:03] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
We need full audit logging of every data access, transformation, and model execution with tamper-proof storage.

[09:18] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[09:34] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
All ML model outputs must include feature importance scores and decision explanations in human-readable format for regulatory review.

[09:50] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[10:04] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[10:14] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
Transaction scoring must complete within 50 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.

[10:31] Robert Rodriguez (Customer Success Manager):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[10:44] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
System failover must complete within 30 seconds with zero data loss for in-flight transactions.

[11:02] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
Noted. That's a hard constraint, not a nice-to-have. We'll design the architecture with that as a non-negotiable baseline.

[11:15] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
All data must be retained for a minimum of 7 years in compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations.

[11:33] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[11:49] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
The platform must support data residency requirements across multiple jurisdictions including EU, US, and APAC.

[12:11] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[12:23] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[12:32] Michael Rodriguez (Solution Architect):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[12:47] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
We should loop in the infrastructure team for the next call to discuss compute provisioning and network configuration.

[12:57] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[13:07] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[13:18] Sarah Lee (Product Manager):
No, I think we covered a lot of ground today. Really productive session. Thanks everyone.

[13:25] Michelle Rodriguez (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #048 - Vertex Group (Retail)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~17 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Mixed
================================================================================

[00:00] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Aisha Taylor and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Vertex Group.

[00:12] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:20] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Hey team, I'm Sarah Rodriguez, serving as Product Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:28] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
Hey team, I'm Nicole Martinez, serving as Technical Lead. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:36] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Hi everyone, Tom Jackson here. I'm the Solution Engineer on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:41] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:50] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:59] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:06] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:16] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
We're losing $2M per quarter in markdowns because our demand forecasting is off by 20-30%. We're either overstocked or out of stock on key SKUs.

[01:36] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[01:53] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[02:09] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[02:25] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:34] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Our pricing team is making decisions based on weekly reports. Competitors are adjusting prices hourly and we're always a step behind.

[02:49] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[03:03] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[03:24] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:41] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:54] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[04:04] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
Users must be able to create and test pricing rules with A/B testing capabilities including geographic and demographic segmentation.

[04:26] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[04:41] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
The platform must support customer identity resolution across online, mobile app, in-store, and loyalty program touchpoints.

[05:00] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[05:13] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
The system must generate automated replenishment recommendations based on real-time inventory levels, lead times, and forecasted demand.

[05:35] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Makes sense. We should also think about how that requirement evolves over the next 12-18 months. Is that scope likely to expand?

[05:53] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
The platform must support what-if scenario modeling for promotional campaigns including cannibalization effects.

[06:12] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
That's clear. From an implementation standpoint, Foundry IQ can support that through the Pipeline Builder. We'd configure the data flows to match those specifications.

[06:28] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:41] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
The system must maintain data freshness of 15 minutes or less for inventory positions across all stores.

[06:56] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[07:12] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
The customer data platform must handle 50 million unique customer profiles with sub-second lookup times.

[07:33] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[07:49] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
The demand forecasting engine must process predictions for 500,000 SKUs across all locations within a 2-hour batch window.

[08:06] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
That's a rigorous target. We'll need to validate that during the load testing phase. I'd suggest we build performance benchmarks into the acceptance criteria.

[08:24] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
Platform must support a Black Friday traffic spike of 20x normal volume without service degradation.

[08:40] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:53] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
On the customer experience front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

[09:10] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Good point. We should validate that assumption during the POC phase before committing to it for the full rollout.

[09:28] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
I want to walk through the data model. We've identified about 20 core object types in the ontology. Each one maps to a business entity and has defined relationships to other objects.

[09:44] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Agreed. Let me add that to the architecture decision record so we have it documented.

[09:59] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
For the pricing optimization workflow specifically, I want to build a feedback loop where the model outputs are validated against actual outcomes and the model is retrained on a configurable schedule.

[10:20] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[10:38] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):

[12:08] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
Let's talk about environments. We'll need at least three - development, staging, and production. Foundry IQ supports project-level isolation which maps well to this.

[12:28] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
Can you elaborate on that? How does that compare to the approach we discussed in the pre-call?

[12:43] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
One thing I want to flag is the importance of getting the ontology right. In my experience, about 60% of implementation issues trace back to an ontology that doesn't accurately represent the business domain.

[12:58] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
I like that approach. Have you seen that pattern work at this scale before?

[13:12] Tom Jackson (Solution Engineer):
We should discuss the build pipeline. I'm thinking we use incremental builds wherever possible to keep compute costs down. Foundry IQ's build scheduler is quite sophisticated for dependency management.

[13:32] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
For the ingestion layer, we'll set up connectors to all your source systems. Foundry IQ supports both batch and streaming ingestion, so we can configure each source based on its latency requirements.

[13:48] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
That makes sense. One question though - how does that handle the edge case where we have conflicting data from two different sources?

[14:00] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
I'm recommending we implement a medallion architecture - bronze for raw data, silver for cleaned and conformed data, and gold for business-ready aggregations and ontology objects.

[14:21] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
For the Quiver analytics layer, we should pre-compute the most common aggregations. This gives us sub-second query performance for the dashboards that get the most traffic.

[14:35] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
Quick question on that - does Foundry IQ support that natively or would we need to build a custom extension?

[16:27] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[16:39] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[16:49] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[17:00] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
Let's schedule a follow-up session specifically focused on the security and compliance architecture.

[17:14] Sarah Rodriguez (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[17:29] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[17:40] Nicole Martinez (Technical Lead):
Nothing from my side. Appreciate everyone's time. Looking forward to the next steps.

[17:47] Aisha Taylor (Solution Architect):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.

CALL #049 - NextGen Systems (Manufacturing)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 4
Call Type: Problem Discovery
================================================================================

[00:00] Robert Thompson (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Robert Thompson and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for NextGen Systems.

[00:10] Robert Thompson (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:18] Wei Chen (Product Manager):
Hey team, I'm Wei Chen, serving as Product Manager. Looking forward to a productive session.

[00:26] Chris Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Hi everyone, Chris Thompson here. I'm the Customer Success Manager on this engagement. Excited to be part of this.

[00:32] Sarah Thompson (Solution Architect):
Good morning. Sarah Thompson, Solution Architect. I've been working closely with the NextGen Systems team on the pre-work for this.

[00:40] Robert Thompson (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:51] Sarah Thompson (Solution Architect):

[00:58] Robert Thompson (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[01:05] Robert Thompson (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:20] Wei Chen (Product Manager):
Our supply chain planning still relies on spreadsheets. When a supplier misses a delivery, it takes 2 days to understand the downstream impact on production schedules.

[01:41] Robert Thompson (Data Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:55] Chris Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Sure. Just last week, we had a situation where the data was 36 hours stale. The team made a decision based on that data and it cost us a significant customer escalation.

[02:14] Wei Chen (Product Manager):
I've seen Foundry IQ address exactly this kind of challenge at other organizations. The key is getting the data integration right from the start.

[02:32] Robert Thompson (Data Engineer):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:42] Chris Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
We're collecting 2TB of IoT data per day from the factory floor but only analyzing about 5% of it. The rest just sits in cold storage because we don't have the tools to process it.

[03:04] Chris Thompson (Customer Success Manager):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[03:16] Sarah Thompson (Solution Architect):
We're using a mix of custom scripts, some legacy ETL tools, and honestly a lot of Excel. It's not sustainable and everyone knows it.

[03:36] Wei Chen (Product Manager):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[03:51] Wei Chen (Product Manager):
Let's talk about monitoring and observability. We need to instrument the pipelines so we know immediately when data quality drops or a pipeline fails.

[04:09] Sarah Thompson (Solution Architect):

[06:12] Sarah Thompson (Solution Architect):
On the predictive maintenance front, we need to implement data classification at the ontology level. Foundry IQ has a tagging system that lets us mark sensitive fields and automatically enforce access policies.

================================================================================
CALL #050 - Global Industries (Technology)
Date: 2026-02-11
Duration: ~10 minutes
Participants: 3
Call Type: Requirements Gathering
================================================================================

[00:00] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's call. I'm Carlos Davis and I'll be facilitating our discussion on the Foundry IQ implementation for Global Industries.

[00:10] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Before we jump in, let me do a quick round of introductions so everyone knows who's on the line.

[00:17] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
Hi, Michelle Thomas here, Technical Lead. Happy to dive into the details today.

[00:23] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
Good morning. Robert Jackson, Product Manager. I've been working closely with the Global Industries team on the pre-work for this.

[00:28] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Great. So for today's agenda, I'd like to cover the current challenges you're facing, walk through the Foundry IQ solution approach, and then discuss implementation specifics. Sound good?

[00:37] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
Sounds good. I'd also like to make sure we carve out time toward the end to talk about requirements and success criteria.

[00:46] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Absolutely, we'll make sure we get to that. Let's get started.

[00:52] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Let's start by getting a clear picture of the current pain points. Can someone walk us through the biggest challenges you're facing today?

[01:06] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
Our product analytics pipeline has a 4-hour lag. Product managers are making feature decisions based on yesterday's data while A/B tests are running in real time.

[01:24] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
How long has this been a problem? And what have you tried so far to address it?

[01:40] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
We estimate it's costing us roughly $1.5 million annually in lost productivity alone. And that doesn't account for the downstream effects on customer satisfaction.

[01:57] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
That's helpful context. From a Foundry IQ perspective, we'd approach this by first building a comprehensive ontology that maps all those data relationships.

[02:15] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
That makes sense. What about the other challenges? I know we had a few more items on the list.

[02:25] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
We've got 15 different microservices each with their own data store and there's no way to answer cross-service business questions without a week-long data engineering project.

[02:43] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
Is that affecting all teams equally or are certain groups hit harder than others?

[02:57] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
The operations team is definitely hit the hardest. They're the ones dealing with the manual workarounds every single day. But it cascades - leadership can't get accurate reports either.

[03:18] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
So one of the things Foundry IQ does really well is handle that data fragmentation problem. The platform's designed to bring together heterogeneous data sources into a coherent model.

[03:34] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Alright, let's shift gears and talk about requirements. I want to make sure we capture both the functional needs - what the system must do - and the non-functional requirements around performance, security, and reliability.

[03:48] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Let's start with functional requirements. What are the must-have capabilities for Phase 1?

[03:59] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
We need automated feature flag integration that correlates experiment assignments with behavioral outcomes across the full conversion funnel.

[04:17] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
Got it. I want to flag that one as high priority. Can we put a hard requirement around that in the design document?

[04:34] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
The system must support real-time event streaming with exactly-once semantics for product analytics events.

[04:53] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[05:09] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
We need automated data pipeline monitoring with SLA tracking, freshness alerts, and dependency-aware failure notifications.

[05:27] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
I agree that's critical. We'll want to build automated tests around that requirement so we can validate it continuously as the platform evolves.

[05:45] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
The system must support multi-tenant data isolation with configurable compute and storage quotas per tenant.

[06:07] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
Good. Let me make sure I understand the acceptance criteria there. Are we talking about a binary pass/fail or are there graduated levels of compliance?

[06:19] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Good, those functional requirements are solid. Now let's talk about the non-functional side. Performance, scalability, security - what are the hard constraints?

[06:32] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
Query response times for standard dashboards must be under 3 seconds for 95th percentile.

[06:49] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
That aligns with what I've seen in similar deployments. We should plan for capacity testing early in the implementation timeline.

[07:05] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
Event ingestion must handle 500,000 events per second at peak with less than 100ms end-to-end latency.

[07:24] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Understood. Foundry IQ's architecture is designed to meet that kind of SLA. We'll document the specific configuration needed to achieve it.

[07:41] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
New data source onboarding must be completable by a developer in under 4 hours including schema definition and pipeline setup.

[07:58] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
Critical requirement. I'll make sure we build monitoring dashboards in Foundry IQ that track this metric continuously so we can catch any degradation early.

[08:11] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
The system must support blue-green deployments with zero-downtime upgrades.

[08:33] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
I want to make sure we're being realistic there. Let me check with the infrastructure team on what's achievable with the current resource allocation.

[08:49] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
We're getting close to time, so let me try to summarize the key takeaways and action items.

[08:57] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
I'll circulate the updated architecture diagram and ontology mapping by end of week for everyone to review.

[09:10] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
I'll set up the Foundry IQ development environment so the team can start hands-on exploration.

[09:23] Robert Jackson (Product Manager):
I'll draft the requirements document based on today's discussion and send it out for review by Thursday.

[09:33] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Great. I'll send out meeting notes and the follow-up calendar invite today. Any final questions before we wrap?

[09:45] Michelle Thomas (Technical Lead):
All good here. Let's keep the momentum going. Excited to see this come together.

[09:55] Carlos Davis (Data Engineer):
Thanks everyone. Talk to you next week. Have a great rest of your day.
